Nacua was then substituted out of the game.</p><p>Nacua will end his rookie season with new high marks of 105 catches and 1,486 yards.</p><p>The Rams won the game 21020.</p><p>A fifth-round draft pick out of Brigham Young, Nacua has recorded over 100 yards in seven games this season, tying the rookie record set by Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 and matched by Justin Jefferson in 2020 (both first-round draft picks). With receiver Cooper Kupp recovering from a hamstring injury to start the 2023 season, Nacua burst onto the NFL scene. His 59 catches in his first eight games set an NFL record for all players. Entering the Week 18 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, Nacua ranked No. 4 in receiving yards (1,445) and No. 8 in catches (101).</p><p>The Rams sat several starters Sunday because they are assured a playoff spot next week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, Kupp, running back Kyren Williams, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and inside linebacker Ernest Jones all were out. Tight end Tyler Higbee (shoulder) and offensive lineman Joe Noteboom (foot) also didn’t play due to injuries. The 49ers also elected to rest starting quarterback Brock Purdy ahead of their playoff stretch.</p><p>Carson Wentz, whom the Rams signed during their Week 10 bye, started for them on Sunday.</p><p>Wednesday, Wentz said “we’ll do our best” to get Nacua the record, adding, “he’s a stud. Puka’s been a stud. Seeing it from afar, but then coming in here and seeing it up close and personal … I don’t know if he really knows how good he is. He’s still a kid, but I think the sky’s the limit for him and it’s cool that he’s getting the recognition that he is and hopefully he can get that record.”</p><p>Rams coach Sean McVay also said Wednesday that the team would be “smart with” Nacua although they wanted to give him the opportunity to “do something special.”</p><p>There’s another interesting layer to Nacua’s milestone. Some senior members of the Rams’ scouting department, plus general manager Les Snead, once worked with Groman after his playing days in Atlanta.</p><p>Snead and senior personnel executives Brian Xanders and Taylor Morton learned from Groman in the Falcons scouting department and Morton ultimately was promoted to Southwest area scout upon Groman’s retirement in 2003. Groman was deeply admired by the three younger scouts.</p><p>Twenty years later, Snead, Morton and Xanders were among those with the Rams who scouted and drafted the player who broke Groman’s record.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Athletic'}],\n   'author': 'The Athletic',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Athletic'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:24:10 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=0, tm_min=24, tm_sec=10, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Former Utah quarterback Alex Smith and former Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss are the first two inductees announced for the College Football Hall of Fame's 2024 class.

I mean, I’m human,” George said Saturday night after totaling six points, three assists, and two rebounds in 16:01 of court time against the Sixers. “It’s gonna take some time to get back to where I was and try to figure out times be aggressive and times where you’re trying to get people involved.”</p><p>His performance vs. Philly was a microcosm of his play since his return.</p><p>It was assumed upon George being cleared for action that his bench role was temporary, a protective measure enacted as he navigated training staff-imposed minutes restrictions and regained his game conditioning and timing.</p><p>Teammate <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/12/27/utah-jazz-coach-will-hardy-mightve/\" target=\"_blank\">Collin Sexton</a>’s recent explosion of efficient productivity, though, threw a wrench into those plans.

And we’re trying to break him of that habit.”</p><p>The coach elaborated that a 50% shooter in the league typically doesn’t follow a miss one/make one/miss one/make one pattern. Players sometimes brick in bunches, but they need to maintain the mindset that the next one will go in if they are to remain effective.</p><p>“Keyonte will have moments where he’ll miss a few shots in a row and then he sort of backs off,” Hardy added. “That comes from a good place. He’s a good player, he has a good concept of being a part of the team, he likes to move the ball. [But] when he doesn’t see a few go in, I think he starts to overcompensate a little bit.”</p><p>In Saturday’s first half, George was on the court for all of 6 minutes and 27 seconds, and frankly was mostly invisible during that time, garnering two defensive rebounds, committing two turnovers, and attempting zero field goals.</p><p>His Jazz teammates know he is trying to navigate how best to help the team without trying to force the action.

Obviously, you’re coming into this league, you’re playing against the best 400 players in the world,” said John Collins, who had 19 points on 9-for-10 shooting Saturday. “… Key obviously belongs in this league and belongs on the court. Really, it’s the mental grind for him.”</p><p>Sexton is making it a point to repeat the same message ad nauseum: Don’t compound mistakes with piled-on self-doubt, just trust in yourself and your teammates.</p><p>“That’s something that I keep telling him: ‘Yo, on to the next play. Continue to fight. We believe in you,’” said Sexton. “… The more you play, the more possessions, the more minutes you have, you’re going to start seeing your game elevate.”</p><p>Hardy knows that George is thinking entirely too much sometimes of late, rather than playing instinctually.</p><p>And he knows precisely why, too.</p><p>“I’ve said to him a lot: ‘You have a hard job as a lead guard, because I want you to shoot <i>and</i> pass on every play,’” Hardy said. “That’s just the way it goes.”</p><p>“He’s got it spot-on,” George conceded with a chagrined smile when told of the comment.</p><p>But that’s something he needs to get used to, his coach continued. Being in the second unit with noted gunner Jordan Clarkson <i>can’t</i> become an excuse to be deferential. Neither can being in the starting lineup alongside All-Star Lauri Markkanen, for that matter.</p><p>“He’s playing with good players. There’s no excuse,” said Hardy. “If you want to be on a good team, you’re going to play alongside other good players, and so he’s learning that now.”</p><p>And George is, indeed, learning.</p><p>Following that ineffectual stint before the break Saturday, something seemed to flip when he checked in with 4:29 left in the third quarter.</p><p>“I think today was, in the second half, one of my more aggressive games as far as getting downhill,” said George. “Everything’s starting to come back together.”</p><p>It began with a jab-step against Sixers star Tyrese Maxey on the perimeter, then utilizing a screen to fly down a wide-open lane. The ensuing slam at the 2:50 mark of the third was George’s first field-goal attempt of the game.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">nothing but room for take off 🛫<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TakeNote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TakeNote</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keyonte1george?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@keyonte1george</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jSmGHufRIa\">pic.twitter.com/jSmGHufRIa</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743820753160777980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>About a minute and a half later, he fired away from 3 and missed, but didn’t get any less aggressive.</p><p>A subsequent possession saw him swiftly move the ball, and he wound up with a hockey assist, as his pass to Ochai Agbaji was forwarded on to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/04/kelly-olynyk-his-wife-reunited/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Olynyk</a> for a made 3-pointer.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, he nicely executed the two-man game with Walker Kessler, taking a screen from the big man, occupying both Maxey and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/07/10/sixers-match-utah-jazzs-offer/\" target=\"_blank\">center Paul Reed</a>, and then feeding Kessler for a slam.</p><p>Later on, George got yet another screen from Kessler, this time on noted defender Patrick Beverley, and as he went around, he attacked the space between Nic Batum and Reed and didn’t hesitate to put up a midrange runner that dropped in.</p><p>Not quite 4 minutes into the fourth, another screen set him up to beat Maxey off dribble going left, after which he charged down the lane, drew multiple defenders, and flung a well-placed pass to Agbaji in the far corner for a 3-point try.</p><p>And a half-minute after that, he took a pass from Kessler and quickly moved it on to Markkanen in the other corner, this time for a made triple that put Utah up 105-91.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">pass<br />pass<br />catch &amp; 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘵 <a href=\"https://t.co/BhdvxtORXu\">pic.twitter.com/BhdvxtORXu</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743823069788201426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>On this occasion, George said, it wasn’t a pep talk from any teammate or coach that got him to dial up the aggression.</p><p>“That was a conversation with myself, to be honest,” he said.</p><p>Hardy thought the timing was perfect considering the opponent, as he views Maxey’s progress as a blueprint for what’s possible with George.</p><p>A combo guard drafted in the middle of the first round, Maxey had to learn that same balance between when to defer to talented teammates such as Joel Embiid and James Harden, and when to exploit the scoring opportunities being presented to him.</p><p>And now, Maxey is having a transcendent breakthrough, averaging 25.9 points and 6.6 assists while shooting 37.4% from 3 as Philly’s No. 2 option behind the reigning MVP.</p><p>George is clearly a bit away from that right now.</p><p>But stringing together more and more moments like the ones he had in the second half against the Sixers could potentially get him there.</p><p>“We’re trying to just regain that aggressiveness when he’s on the floor that he had before he got injured. Right now I’m seeing a little bit of what we saw at the beginning of the year with him, where he has flashes of aggression but can also kind of fade back into the background a little bit. So it’s going to be a little bit of a work in progress,” said Hardy. “… He’s in a spot that I would anticipate — there’s nights where the balance is good, and there’s nights where he defers to the veteran guys. We’re trying to help him work through that, help him see the film and recognize that it’s OK to be aggressive when the game tells you to be aggressive.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Scott D.

Straight up,” Bistline told The Tribune. “Every facet of these extreme polygamous groups, there’s always children who are suffering. There’s always crimes against children.”</p><p>She makes that point quite forcefully in “Secrets of Polygamy,” which premieres Monday on A&amp;E. In addition to the FLDS, there are episodes that feature the Kingstons (aka The Order) and the Apostolic United Brethren.</p><p>Bistline — who grew up with three mothers and 27 siblings — didn’t exactly jump at the chance to appear in “Secrets.” She’s done interviews before, but this is her first time on TV, and she struggled with the decision because she knew it would, inevitably, involve her bringing members of her family into it.</p><p>“I was very scared about re-victimizing my little sisters and the women in my family,” Bistline said. “And also exploiting them, and telling their story without their permission.”</p><p>She eventually said yes to the show’s producers because she “started to get frustrated with the fact that my little sisters wouldn’t come forward” as witnesses in the case against Samuel Bateman.

Bistline said her older brother gave his underage daughters — one just 12 years old — to Bateman as wives. (The brother was arrested last May, and other members of Bistline’s family are also facing charges.)</p><p>Bistline is in the first of 10 episodes of “Secrets of Polygamy,”, which airs Monday on A&amp;E — 8 p.m. on Dish and DirecTV; 11 p.m. on Comcast. She agreed to be interviewed, she said, when she “started to realize” her sisters wouldn’t come forward “because they didn’t have an example in their life of someone doing that. I decided to speak out to be an example.”</p><p>As she explains in the program, Bistline left the FLDS Church in 2011, when she was 19. She said she felt there was “more than this” to life and she didn’t want “to be stuck in a marriage where I was just one of multiple women and I don’t have an identity. And my only purpose in life is to have children. … That can be a great purpose. But if that’s chosen for me, it feels like I’m an object.”</p><p>And entering the world outside the church “was a culture shock, for sure.” She not only recalls wearing a bikini for the first time, but has vivid memories of when she began wearing pants. “I would catch myself in the mirror and just, like, shock myself, because I had legs,” she said with a laugh. “I mean, I don’t want to say it wasn’t hard, because I was missing my family a lot. But it was very exciting.”</p><img alt=\"Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune\\n\\nHandcuffed and flanked by Las Vegas Metro PD Swat officers, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs appeared before Judge James M.

(Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>Bistline went to college, got a nursing degree, and “nursing became my new identity.” But now Bateman “has entered the chat.”</p><p>“There was a period of years between when I left and when Sam Bateman took over my family that I felt pretty normal,” Bistline said. “I went years trying to shove it away. I wanted to be known for my career and my brain. And then when all of this started happening with Sam Bateman, I had a realization that there’s … not a greater cause than to fight for children who are stuck in situations like this.”</p><p>“Secrets” isn’t the first documentary or series about polygamy, and it’s not chock full of secrets. Most of it will only be new to those who haven’t paid much attention. It’s in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2022/06/06/scott-d-pierce-netflix/\">“Keep Sweet”</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2015/07/14/in-new-utah-set-reality-show-former-kingston-women-reveal-the-oppressive-abusive-side-of-polygamy/\">“Escaping Polygamy”</a> — it’s not one of those so-called reality shows like <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51379403&amp;itype=CMSID\">“Sister Wives,”</a> which quickly devolved into unintended comedy.</p><p>It’s a serious story, complete with ominous music and a straightforward narrative that is a bit flat. If you’re already interested in the subject of polygamy, it will be of interest to you. And, judging by the number of shows and documentaries about polygamy, there are plenty of people who are interested. Exactly why is hard to say, even for a former member of the FLDS Church.</p><p>“This is my life. It’s hard for me to step outside and see what the fascination is,” Bistline said. “I don’t know what it’s like to have just a two-parent household.”</p><p>But she has come to some conclusions about the FLDS Church, the people who remain in it and the people who’ve escaped.</p><p>“Growing up, I was always told that anyone who leaves regrets it and they always want to come back,” Bistline said. “And in my brain, I thought, ‘Oh, they can’t survive without the religion. They need the religion because they need a purpose.’</p><p>“But once I left, I realized, ‘Oh my God, it’s not the religion that they need — it’s their family.’ That’s the hard part.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

We married in Utah seven years ago and recently welcomed two amazing children into our lives; we’ve been spending time these past few weeks reflecting on Utah’s evolution on LGBTQ+ people.</p><p>We’ve come so far since the 2004 passage of Amendment 3 — the constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from marrying passed with 65% support. Polling now shows a complete reversal, with one tracking 72% of Utahns supporting marriage for same-sex couples. Strikingly, leaders in the state have evolved, too: Gov. Spencer Cox has spoken movingly about dignity for LGBTQ+ people, and before him, Gov. Jon Huntsman was an early Republican to express support for marriage equality. Just last year Mitt Romney was one of 12 <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/11/29/23484230/respect-for-marriage-act-mike-lee-amendment-mitt-romney-vote\">Republican senators</a> to approve the Respect for Marriage Act, which will protect marriages like ours no matter what happens at the U.S. Supreme Court in the years ahead.</p><p>If the Supreme Court were to take up a challenge to same-sex couples’ freedom to marry, they’d be wise to look at Utah and how much we’ve changed. Even the LDS Church, once one of the most powerful opponents of the freedom to marry, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/religion-relationships-gay-rights-utah-07847f4b7e3e96d81c10a298a199b860\">voiced support</a> for the Respect for Marriage Act.</p><p>That’s not to say there’s no work ahead: The passage of anti-transgender laws in Utah was a heartbreaking part of 2023, and we must continue pushing forward. But the 10-year anniversary of the freedom to marry is a good reminder to always speak out for dignity and equality — because change and growth are possible.</p><p><i>Jason Myers and Brian Nicholls, Salt Lake City</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/09/08/how-share-your-opinion-with-salt/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Submit a letter to the editor</i></a></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: What will it take for Utahns to open their hearts and accept diversity?',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Letter: What will it take for Utahns to open their hearts and accept diversity?'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum'}],\n   'author': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:01 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs around the country are being shut down.

However, with 73% enrollment being white students, as a biracial woman born and raised in Utah, it tells me there’s still a lot more work to be done and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs are very much needed.</p><p>What will it take for Utahns, or for that matter, Americans, to open their hearts and minds to the unfamiliar, accept diversity, and seek to create an equitable, just, kind and inclusive world?</p><p><i>Maurena Grossman, Salt Lake City</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/09/08/how-share-your-opinion-with-salt/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Submit a letter to the editor</i></a></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Opinion: The Claudine Gay debacle was never about merit',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Opinion: The Claudine Gay debacle was never about merit'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-claudine-gay-debacle-was/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-claudine-gay-debacle-was/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-claudine-gay-debacle-was/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Tressie McMillan Cottom | The New York Times'}],\n   'author': 'Tressie McMillan Cottom | The New York Times',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Tressie McMillan Cottom | The New York Times'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Claudine Gay’s resignation this week as Harvard University’s president marks the end of a shameful chapter for the institution. The debacle’s architects promise to make America’s elite institutions great again. They say they pushed out Gay and, nearly a month ago, the University of Pennsylvania’s president as a warning to the nation’s cultural institutions. How they will continue to wield their influence and if they will succeed depends on how willing we all are to keep buying age-old ideas about merit from power-hungry peddlers.</p><p>Gay’s resignation comes nearly a month after she, along with the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania, testified before Congress. (Columbia University was also invited. It declined. As the kids say, Columbia understood the assignment.) These particular schools were chosen not because of their academic bona fides but because of their cultural significance. Yes, Harvard, Penn and MIT boast highly selective admissions and lauded faculty. But they are also institutions with strong international brands built on prestige, history and the perception of excellence. A hearing ostensibly about antisemitism on campus quickly became little more than a coordinated political spectacle about power.</p><p>You do not have to take my word for it. You can believe Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who was one of the architects of the debacle, who celebrated on X, formerly Twitter, this week for having “SCALPED” Gay. Distinct from the campaign waged against Penn’s former president Elizabeth Magill, the attacks against Gay have been cut from whole cloth, from a historical narrative about merit and diversity that is a hallmark of America’s higher-education prestige hierarchy.</p><p>Rufo explained his plan for ginning up controversy about higher education’s most prestigious universities in an interview on the heels of Gay’s resignation, explaining that it was a coordinated, strategic attack that used narrative, financial and political leverage. His partners included members of Congress, wealthy donors, journalists, media and a bloodthirsty audience. Riding high on success, Rufo said his strategy could push the conservative movement back into what he considers its rightful place: the top of America’s most powerful cultural institutions.</p><p>The three legs of Rufo’s strategic stool are basic organizing tools — creating a message, attracting financial patronage and forging political alliances. It is notable that he can pull these levers. But that may say more about our times than about Rufo himself. The financial donors who wanted to exert control had the money and political will. The politicians have been freed from the shackles of voters who would penalize them for bad behavior. If there is any real strategy at work here, it is the message the Rufo team created. He gives credit to conservative journalists like Christopher Brunet and Aaron Sibirium. The message interpolates several old tropes into a liberal-sounding message about merit.</p><p>Rufo says he smuggled a narrative into “the left-wing media.” That narrative rests on a critical discursive link — DEI is synonymous with “lacking merit.” It is a neat trick. Harvard’s endowment has been valued at nearly $50 billion. Yet, the Rufo messaging strategy successfully painted the institution’s president as an undeserving beneficiary, even if she is not.</p><p>The specter of DEI made her presidency sound like a voucher program for a welfare recipient and not the internal promotion of a long-term employee to leadership. When you hear someone from the reactionary crowd talk about DEI’s undue influence over an institution like Harvard, he sounds like a royal who finds himself forced to go to the DMV for the first time. Subjected to rules designed for hoi polloi, forced into lines with people who need the government and unable to buy his way out of it. It is not genius. It is a powerful rhetorical strategy because it merged the political craftsmanship of the 1988 Willie Horton ad with the moralism of federalism.</p><p>It plays on the latent but powerful idea that government — big government — unfairly helps undeserving people, many of them women and people of color, who drain the pool of opportunity for deserving people. DEI is “bad” because it supplants merit for diversity and it empowers the racialized federal government to stick its hands into an institution that produces the cultural elite. That made Harvard a <i>public problem</i>. The public proved all too willing to weigh in on whether a tenured professor deserved her job, with its role, status and ranking. Once this link was secured, every other charge became stickier.</p><p>Rufo wants to be certain that he gets credit. That is a lot of ego talking, but he may have a point. Despite his broadcasting his plans on X, laying out his strategy like a cartoon villain and claiming victory to anyone who will listen, some people still want to find more genteel explanations. Conservative commentators blame diversity itself for the Harvard debacle, arguing that a “social justice model” of higher education has supplanted a merit model at our nation’s colleges and universities. It is most galling at the most prestigious institutions, where status granted without concern for merit breeds resentment. Consequently, academic rigor and culture have receded from Western civilization’s high-water mark.</p><p>It is a popular idea. Some scholars believe it. A lot of the alt-right believes it. Regular people complaining about someone getting into college when they did not “deserve” to believe it. The underlying belief is noxious. It presumes diversity and merit are mutually exclusive. Beyond that, whether higher education is less meritorious now than it was in some unspecified past cannot be measured.</p><p>That is because merit, itself, cannot be defined. That is why the concept is so useful for slippery slopes. It cannot be proved or disproved. It can only be argued.</p><p>Academicians and practitioners know that you cannot operationalize merit. But historians know that there is powerful evidence about merit in the archives of our nation’s elite institutions. Whenever politicians, activists and investors agree that there is a merit crisis at Harvard, it signals that a battle rages, not over rigor, but over power.</p><p>In the 1880s, Harvard was willing to train a small group of women in art, literature and philosophy. But there were limits. Class and race, obviously. But also a limit on just how legitimate this training was when pursued by the female sex. Some worried that educating women could corrupt their natural talents and that coeducational learning could compromise character development for men and women.</p><p>In the 1920s, Harvard (along with Yale and Princeton) were dismayed that so many Jewish students were passing its carefully designed admissions tests. The institutions set out to revise those tests to account for all manner of cultural and physical attributes to filter out those Jewish students. The tests included questions about “character” that amounted to a litmus test for race and ethnicity. Jerome Karabel, in his book “The Chosen,” shows this redefinition of merit at Harvard, Yale and Princeton over and over again as elite institutions fight not to defend rigor but to maintain their hold on status amid social changes in America.</p><p>Wave after wave of immigrants, minorities and other socially mobile groups of people in the United States have experienced a similar story with Harvard. Each successive fight for the university’s soul was cloaked in language about merit. Well-meaning scolds worried about immigrants’ test scores or poor students’ cultural fit or whether women could do math. Every time, the moral case for “diversity” must contend with the supposedly rational case for “merit” or achievement. There are often religious overtones, harking back to America’s manifest destiny; it’s as if the country will dissolve into a failed state if merit’s clerics do not defend its virtues.</p><p>All of this dichotomous thinking forgets one thing: Academics are not born; they’re made. More broadly, administrators of Harvard, or anywhere else for that matter, are not born; they are made. They are promoted and trained. Surely, Harvard can train a bureaucrat.</p><p>Of course Harvard can train a bureaucrat. It trains the world’s leaders. It also runs the Harvard Seminar for New Presidents, which trains university presidents. It is part of academic leadership culture and the administrative industry that has grown around higher education.</p><p>What I have found particularly interesting (if not a little shocking) about this whole affair is that Gay’s promotion to president is so utterly <i>normal</i>. Rufo has described her scholarship record as “thin,” but university leadership has been professionalized for at least two decades. Competitive programs recruit and train cohorts of early-career scholars to prepare them to become provosts and presidents. Beyond that, “nontraditional” university presidents are highly prized in the modern university. University boards view them as market-friendly and business-savvy.</p><p>As has happened historically, Gay’s detractors redefined merit to mean whatever they wanted it to mean, in practice turning bureaucratic minutiae into a political bomb. Joseph McCarthy could only have wished for the networked media power that today’s reactionary power-seekers possess. The speed, scale and amplification of the power to capture an aspect of routine workaday life and cast it as nefarious activity is staggering. What has happened at Harvard is not just a blueprint for taking over higher education; it is a strategy for taking over our information environment.</p><p>I don’t like to argue about the human resources problems of rich private colleges. But love them or hate them, the Ivies set the Overton window for a lot of higher education. Colleges without Harvard’s media spotlight and billions of dollars are more vulnerable. Countless mobilized reactionary groups have more media attention than they have organic audience. They know how to capture media, court financial donors and form political alliances. They do not need a wide community of adherents to make themselves look like a movement.</p><p>If you like Rufo’s vision of a status hierarchy, in which merit is whatever the winner says it is, then he’s your man. In his vision for the New College of Florida, liberal arts has been diminished, gender studies has been marginalized and merit — whatever that means — trumps social justice. Harvard can buttress the consequences with prestige and money. The rest of higher education will find it harder. Networked, nationalized and emboldened, Rufo has nothing standing in his way. If Florida feels like the future you desire, you are in luck. Florida’s architects are winning.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/opinion/claudine-gay-resignation-harvard.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Shurtleff, Swallow and now Reyes.

(Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>A ‘for sale’ sign on the office door</p><p>The scandal that engulfed Shurtleff and Swallow was years in the making. It began to unravel days after Shurtleff handed over the reins to Swallow, his hand-picked successor. In <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=24883333&amp;itype=storyID\">January 2013</a>, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Swallow had huddled the previous spring at an Orem Krispy Kreme shop with Jeremy Johnson, who was under a federal indictment at the time.</p><p>Johnson and a business partner <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=24883333&amp;itype=storyID\">had paid Swallow $250,000 in an effort to persuade then-U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to intervene and stave off the federal charges</a>. Johnson characterized the money as a payoff; Swallow insisted it was for lobbying. Either way, it hadn’t worked, and now Johnson and a partner wanted the money back.</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55717936&amp;itype=cmsid\">Johnson had secretly taped the meeting</a> as the two men talked about money that had changed hands, alleged payments to Reid to back the online poker industry, Swallow wondering if he was under investigation, and Johnson advising him to buy a burner phone — which he later did.</p><p>Other questions soon arose.</p><p>Evidence emerged that Swallow and Shurtleff had taken gifts from Johnson — use of his private jet, stays in Johnson’s lavish St. George homes and <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55734633&amp;itype=cmsid\">Swallow’s use of Johnson’s Lake Powell houseboat</a>, complete with a helipad — in exchange for their support in receiving a legal opinion from the attorney general’s office that would enable Johnson and his partners to <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55834555&amp;itype=CMSID\">process online poker transactions</a>, a potentially lucrative business.</p><p>Swallow and Shurtleff were also accused by a then-jailed businessman, Marc Sessions Jenson, of <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56282825&amp;itype=CMSID\">pressuring him into providing them ritzy stays at his resort home</a> in Newport Beach, Calif., and other gifts at a time the businessman was under the supervision of the attorney general’s office pursuant to a plea deal that Shurtleff had allegedly negotiated.</p><p>As the revelations rolled out, a series of investigations came to life. The <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56292844&amp;itype=CMSID\">lieutenant governor’s office hired a law firm to investigate potential campaign finance violations</a>. The Legislature — as it has done with Reyes — <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56566800&amp;itype=CMSID\">initiated a pair of audits</a>. The FBI, along with prosecutors in Davis and Salt Lake counties, ramped up criminal inquiries.</p><p>In the Utah House, Republicans debated whether to launch an impeachment inquiry or whether to wait and see what federal agents uncovered.</p><p>Spencer Cox, then a freshman representative just a few months in office, spoke passionately, assailing his colleagues resisting a House investigation of “shirking” their responsibility. The House should fulfill its constitutional duty, he prodded, not rely on the loathed federal government.</p><p>“I’m embarrassed by members of our own body who rail against the federal government and then plead for us to wait for the now suddenly brilliant Federal Bureau of Investigation to do our constitutional responsibility,” Cox chided. “I’ll be damned if I’m going to let them restore the public trust.”</p><p>A few months later, <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56974682&amp;itype=CMSID\">then-Gov.

Swallow <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/03/19/former-utah-attorney/\">challenged Reyes for the Republican nomination in 2020</a>, partly criticizing Reyes’ focus on trafficking overseas as a distraction from his duties as attorney general. Swallow lost.</p><p>What reforms may be needed?</p><p>Now Reyes finds himself facing a measure of the scrutiny his predecessors endured — minus allegations of criminal misconduct — and is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/07/ag-sean-reyes-wont-run-reelection/\">stepping down after his current term expires in January 2025</a>.</p><p>Going forward, though, a big question has become whether structural changes are needed to avoid another repeat of the problems in the future.</p><p>Chris Toth, who spent 18 years on the staff of the National Association of Attorneys General, said it begins with the individual — someone who is committed to public service, adheres to strict ethical standards and instills that culture throughout the office.</p><p>That has grown more challenging. As attorneys general have become more powerful and the amount of money spent trying to influence them has mushroomed, Toth said that requires candidates to rigorously vet who is giving them money.</p><p>“Generally, if you’re getting involved in lobbying an A.G.,” he said, “there is bad conduct that has occurred or bad conduct that is percolating somewhere.”</p><p>In addition, groups like the Republican Attorneys General Association, its Democratic counterpart, and the Attorney General Alliance have, in recent decades, made it easier for entities that want to spend millions to influence the attorneys general, he said. Often that money is not reported.</p><p>Reyes currently chairs RAGA, which is also by far his biggest campaign donor — funneling nearly $450,000 to his campaign since 2014. And last year, the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/2022/12/01/qatar-paid-utah-ag-sean-reyes/\">government of Qatar paid to send Reyes</a> to the 2022 World Cup with funds channeled through AGA.</p><p>The Swallow investigative committee compiled a series of “suggestions” of policies to address issues arising from that scandal — including a series of changes to campaign finance laws.</p><p>Having a law enforcement official raising large amounts of money creates the potential for conflicts of interest, and Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, who served on the Swallow investigative panel, said it’s worth reexamining those rules.</p><p>One already enacted post-Swallow reform was the creation of an ethics commission for executive offices — governor, attorney general, treasurer and auditor. The Tribune reported last year, however, that<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/01/11/commission-investigate-unethical/\"> the five-member commission had seen long vacancies in several seats</a>, handled its last complaint in 2021, and had an out-of-order hotline.</p><p>Jeff Merchant, executive director of the progressive group Alliance for a Better Utah, said he would like to see an inspector general established with investigative authority over those offices.</p><p>“If we just have the Legislature doing it, I’m sorry, they have an inherent conflict of interest. When it’s Republicans from the top down, there’s some incentive not to rat each other out,” he said. “We need to have somebody who is somewhat independent looking over what it is that these people who have immense amounts of power are doing [and] keeping them in check.”</p><img alt=\"(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Sen.

Michael McKell, R-Spanish Fork, talks with Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City in February 2023. (Leah Hogsten/)</caption><p>Which is best: elected or appointed?</p><p>The proposed change that has received the most attention is McKell’s push to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/10/12/utah-ag-sean-reyes-relationship/\">change the Utah Constitution to give the governor the authority to hire — and fire — the attorney general</a>. It’s a power given to the nation’s president but a rarity at the state level.</p><p>Forty-three <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/attorneys-general/\">states elect their attorneys general</a>; five have the office appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. In Maine, the attorney general is chosen by the Legislature, and, in Tennessee, the attorney general is appointed by the state’s Supreme Court and confirmed by the Legislature.</p><p>McKell is not the first to explore the appointment route. In the mid-1990s, Utah’s Constitutional Revision Commission recommended appointing the attorney general, but many saw the proposal as politically motivated, since at the time Democrat Jan Graham held the office.</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51593842&amp;itype=CMSID\">In 2011, then-Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, floated the idea</a>, arguing it would attract better candidates and alleviate conflicts that arise when they solicit money from people they may have to investigate or prosecute. Two years later, <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56315756&amp;itype=CMSID\">amid the Swallow-Shurtleff uproar, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, revived the proposal</a>, but it has never gained much traction.</p><p>Gov. Cox, who is McKell’s brother-in-law, has said he <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-governor-spencer-cox-attorney-general-sean-reyes-tim-ballard-operation-underground-railroad-mike-mckell-legislature-appoint-elect-ag-office-politics\">believes appointing an attorney general is the best option</a>.</p><p>Reyes has <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2023-11-28/with-reyes-under-scrutiny-is-appointing-utahs-attorney-general-the-answer\">argued it would be a mistake to change the selection process</a> because “appointed A.G.s can’t exercise independent discretion or decision-making, and they become just an extension of the governor or whoever appoints them.”</p><p>While some states have moved from an appointed attorney general to an elected one, <a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/973-994-Online.pdf\">no state has gone in the other direction</a>, according to a 2014 Harvard Law Review article.</p><p>Former state Rep. Lowry Snow, who also served as president of the Utah Bar, said it’s unlikely that voters would support a constitutional amendment that takes away their ability to elect an attorney general.</p><p>“I don’t want to say we’re stuck with — that’s the wrong word — but I don’t see Utah changing its system of how the attorney general is selected,” he said. “So what can we do?”</p><p>Snow said the Legislature could beef up its oversight of the office, with lawmakers taking a deep dive during the summer into how the office is run and requiring the attorney general to provide a report to — and answer questions from — legislators.</p><p>“What I’m really talking about here is transparency and accountability,” Snow said. “I think with our current attorney general and to a large extent his predecessors whom we’ve had issues with, we haven’t had the degree of transparency we should have for the public benefit.”</p><p>For his part, Stoddard is exploring the idea of prohibiting the attorney general from doing legal work outside the office — a limitation that is in place for county attorneys but not at the state level.</p><p>McKell and Stoddard also say the state needs to explore upping the attorney general’s salary. Currently, Utah’s attorney general is paid $173,755 a year. That is well above the average Utah income and the $141,825 average salary for attorneys general nationally, <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/interim/2023/pdf/00004694.pdf\">according to a report earlier this year by a Utah legislative commission that reviews salaries</a>, but it remains significantly lower than comparable private-sector salaries, especially for the head of a large firm.</p><p>“An entry-level associate in downtown Salt Lake makes about the same salary as the sitting attorney general,” said McKell, who is a lawyer. “It opens up the attorney general to these side hustles as we’ve seen for three in a row. And it just decreases the quality of the candidates we get.”</p><p>Stoddard said that also makes the various perks dangled in front of the attorney general — like junkets on private jets — more attractive and creates a sense that he or she is entitled to take them.</p><p>But, as Toth notes, on some level, the job also requires someone willing to turn down perks, refuse problematic contributions, eschew partisan grandstanding and focus on administering justice fairly.</p><p>“At the highest level, it’s a failure to remember it’s not about you. It’s about your constituents,” he said. “It’s a failure to maintain standards of professional conduct for yourself. You’ve got to draw a line somewhere. You’ve got to set standards and adhere to those.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

They ate. They then stood up and cleaned the empty modest receptacles. No waste. No leftovers. I believe leftovers were never anticipated. I don’t think this kitchen even had a Tupperware drawer filled with empty Cool Whip containers from the ‘90s.</p><p>So few people, so much pizza</p><img alt=\"(Alan Diaz | AP) This 2016 photo shows Domino\\'s Pizza boxes.\" height=\"3270\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/wQDZ9IyhmlBX4Bjb9gNan-Eue-0=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/22CDLFANTFBEZO5OKPMNA5PR4Y.jpg\" width=\"4416\" /><br /><caption>(Alan Diaz | AP) This 2016 photo shows Domino\\'s Pizza boxes. (Alan Diaz/)</caption><p>There must be a reason so many of us in Utah know only how to cook for 20. Maybe it’s because, unlike many other families, ours haven’t historically chugged <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/09/23/what-is-lds-word-wisdom/\">wine with dinner</a>, so we turned to an overindulgence in food as our vice of choice. Maybe this behavior is the result of residual cultural trauma from our ancestors’ brutal pioneer treks across the Plains. Maybe there’s a little genetic part of us that still thinks we all belong to large polygamous families. Maybe it’s a dash of all those things.</p><p>But even if genetics can contribute, I did recently learn environmental factors may be just as culpable a cause in some.</p><p>A few months ago, my husband and I hosted a small neighborhood gathering in our backyard. He ordered a number of large pizzas from a place down the street and assigned me to get them as he put the final touches on the several gallons of sangria he had just made a mess in our kitchen preparing.</p><p>When I gave the establishment my husband’s name, the workers directed me to eight large pizza boxes, each with 10 slices. “Are you sure you have the right order?” I asked, doing basic math in my head and determining this would be enough pizza for nearly each attendee to have a box.</p><p>The order was confirmed, and I returned home with the 80 slices of pizza to feed our 10 neighbors.</p><p>At night’s end, my husband and I stood over six untouched boxes of leftover pizza and six wine bottles’ worth of sangria. “I don’t know why I thought this was an appropriate amount of food,” my husband said, in disbelief. “I don’t even remember ordering or making this much.”</p><p>I put my arm around him, squeezed his shoulder and whispered, “Welcome to Zion.”</p><p>He looked at me, wide-eyed and concerned as I whispered again, smiling and staring at him like a hypnotic predator who finally captured its prey.</p><p>“We’ve been waiting for you to join us.”</p><img alt=\"(Pat Bagley)\\nEli McCann, Salt Lake Tribune guest columnist.\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/ljTePq9Rk-cP6REZDVvu_AznBqc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/2W64ITCCPJBSZGTBKOMIT6NVP4.jpg\" width=\"1056\" /><br /><caption>(Pat Bagley)\\nEli McCann, Salt Lake Tribune guest columnist.</caption><p><b>Eli McCann</b> <i>is an attorney, writer and podcaster in Salt Lake City, where he lives with his husband and their two naughty (yet worshipped) dogs.

The war, said Ben-Gvir, presents an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza,” facilitating Israeli settlement in the region.</p><p>The Biden administration has joined countries all over the world in condemning these naked endorsements of ethnic cleansing. But in doing so, it acted as if Ben-Gvir and Smotrich’s provocations are fundamentally at odds with the worldview of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to whom America continues to give unconditional backing. In a statement denouncing the ministers’ words as “inflammatory and irresponsible,” the State Department said, “We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the government of Israel, including by the prime minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government.”</p><p>Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat who has called for a cease-fire, thanked the State Department in a social media post, saying, “It must be clear that America will not write a blank check for mass displacement.”</p><p>But it’s not clear, because we’re writing a blank check to a government whose leader is only a bit more coy than Ben-Gvir and Smotrich about his intentions for Gaza. As Israeli news outlets have reported, Netanyahu said this week that the government is considering a “scenario of surrender and deportation” of residents of the Gaza Strip. According to a Times of Israel article, “The ‘voluntary’ resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza is slowly becoming a key official policy of the government, with a senior official saying that Israel has held talks with several countries for their potential absorption.”</p><p>Some in Israel’s government have denied this, mostly on grounds of impracticality. “It’s a baseless illusion, in my opinion: No country will absorb 2 million people, or 1 million, or 100,000, or 5,000,” one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Israeli journalists. And on Thursday, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, released a plan for the day after the war that said that, contrary to the dreams of the ultranationalists, there would be no Israeli settlement in Gaza.</p><p>But with its widespread destruction of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, including roughly 70% of its housing, Israel is making most of Gaza uninhabitable for the foreseeable future. Disease is rampant in Gaza, hunger almost universal, and the United Nations reports that much of the enclave is at risk of famine. Amid all this horror, members of Netanyahu’s Likud party — such as Danny Danon, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations, and Gila Gamliel, Israel’s intelligence minister — are pushing emigration as a humanitarian solution.</p><p>“Instead of funneling money to rebuild Gaza or to the failed UNRWA,” the United Nations agency that works with Palestinian refugees, “the international community can assist in the costs of resettlement, helping the people of Gaza build new lives in their new host countries,” wrote Gamliel in The Jerusalem Post.</p><p>Right now, this is a grotesque fantasy. But as Gaza’s suffering ratchets up, some sort of evacuation might come to appear to be a necessary last resort. At least, that’s what some prominent Israeli officials seem to be counting on.</p><p>After Hamas’ sadistic attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Israel was justified in retaliating; any country would have. But there is a difference between the war Israel’s liberal supporters want to pretend that the country is fighting in Gaza, and the war Israel is actually waging.</p><p>Pro-Israel Democrats want to back a war to remove Hamas from Gaza. But increasingly, it looks as if America is underwriting a war to remove <i>Gazans</i> from Gaza. Experts in international law can debate whether the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza can be classified as genocidal, as South Africa is claiming at the International Court of Justice, or as some lesser type of war crime. But whatever you want to call attempts to “thin out” Gaza’s population — as the Hebrew newspaper Israel Hayom described an alleged Netanyahu proposal — the United States is implicated in them.</p><p>By acting as if Ben-Gvir and Smotrich can be hived off from the government in which they serve, U.S. policymakers are fostering denial about the character of Netanyahu’s rule. Joe Biden often speaks of his 1973 meeting with Golda Meir, then the prime minister, and like many American Zionists, his view of Israel sometimes seems stuck in that era.</p><p>If you grew up in a liberal Zionist household, as I did, you’ve probably heard this (possibly apocryphal) Meir quote: “When peace comes we will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” There’s much to criticize in this sentiment — its self-regard, the way it positions Israel as the victim even when it’s doing the killing; still, it at least suggests a tortured ambivalence about meting out violence. But this attitude, which Israelis sometimes call “shooting and crying,” is now as obsolete as Meir’s Zionist socialism, at least among Israel’s leaders.</p><p>Among both American and European politicians, said my friend Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator with the Palestinians who now heads the U.S./Middle East Project, there’s a “willful refusal to take seriously just how extreme this government is — whether before Oct. 7 or subsequently.” I’m tempted to say that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich said the quiet part out loud, but in truth they just said the loud part louder.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/opinion/israel-gaza-displacement.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: Before casting your vote for president, remember who called military personnel “suckers” and “losers”',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Letter: Before casting your vote for president, remember who called military personnel “suckers” and “losers”'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum'}],\n   'author': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:01 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Within a month after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, my 19-year-old father enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.

In response, Trump has asked the Supreme Court to intervene on his behalf in the Colorado case, and he has appealed Maine’s decision.</p><p>There is a real question of whether this attempt to protect American democracy — by removing a would-be authoritarian from the ballot — is itself a threat to American democracy. Will proponents and supporters of the 14th Amendment option effectively destroy the village in order to save it?</p><p>It may seem obvious, but we should remember that Trump is not an ordinary political figure. And try as some commentators might, there is no amount of smoke one could create — through strained counterfactuals, dire warnings of a slippery slope or outright dismissal of the events that make the Trump of 2024 a figure very different from the Trump of 2020 — that can obscure or occlude this basic fact.</p><p>In 2020, Trump went to the voting public of the United States and asked for another four years in office. By 51% to 47%, the voting public of the United States said no<i>.</i> More importantly, Trump lost the Electoral College, 306-232, meaning there were enough of those voters in just the right states to deny him a second term.</p><p>The people decided. And Trump said, in so many words, that he didn’t care. What followed, according to the final report of the House select committee on Jan. 6, was an effort to overturn the result of the election.</p><p>Trump, the committee wrote, “unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.” He “oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.” He “summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6,” the day Congress was slated to certify the election results, and “instructed them to march to the Capitol” so that they could “‘take back’ their country.’” He even sent a message on Twitter attacking his vice president, Mike Pence, knowing full well that “a violent attack on the Capitol was underway.”</p><p>In the face of this violence, Trump “refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television.” He did not deploy the National Guard, nor did he “instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist.”</p><p>Trump sought and actively tried to subvert constitutional government and overturn the results of the presidential election. And what he could not do through the arcane rules and procedures of the Electoral College, he tried to do through the threat of brute force, carried out by an actual mob.</p><p>Looked at this way, the case for disqualifying Trump through the 14th Amendment is straightforward. Section 3 states that “No person shall ... hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”</p><p>As the legal scholar Mark A. Graber writes in an amicus brief submitted to the Colorado Supreme Court, “American jurists understood an insurrection against the United States to be an attempt by two or more persons for public reasons to obstruct by force or intimidation the implementation of federal law.” There was also a legal consensus at the time of the amendment’s drafting and ratification that an individual “engaged in insurrection whenever they knowingly incited, assisted or otherwise participated in an insurrection.”</p><p>We also know that the framers of the 14th Amendment did not aim or intend to exclude the president of the United States from its terms. In 1870, the Republican-controlled Senate refused to seat Zebulon Vance, the former Confederate governor of North Carolina. It strains credulity to think that the same Republicans would have sat silent if the Democratic Party had, in 1872, nominated a former Confederate leader for the presidency.</p><p>Under a plain reading of Section 3 — and given the evidence uncovered by the Jan. 6 committee — Trump cannot stand for the presidency of the United States or any other federal office, for that matter.</p><p>The real issue with disqualifying Trump is less constitutional than political. Disqualification, goes the argument, would bring American democracy to the breaking point.</p><p>In this line of thinking, to deny Americans their choice of presidential candidate would destroy any remaining confidence in the American political system. It would also invite Trump’s allies in the Republican Party to do the same to Democrats, weaponizing Section 3 and disqualifying candidates for any number of reasons. Disqualification would also give far more power to the courts when the only appropriate venue for the question of Trump is the voting booth.</p><p>But these objections rest on a poor foundation. They treat Trump as an ordinary candidate and Jan. 6 as a variation on ordinary politics. But as the House select committee established, Jan. 6 and the events leading up to it were nothing of the sort. And while many Americans still contest the meaning of the attack on the Capitol, many Americans also contested, in the wake of the Civil War, the meaning of secession and rebellion. That those Americans viewed Confederate military and political leaders as heroes did not somehow delegitimize the Republican effort to keep them, as much as possible, out of formal political life.</p><p>What unites Trump with the former secessionists under the disqualification clause is that, like them, he refused to listen to the voice of the voting public. He rejected the bedrock principle of democratic life: the peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>The unspoken assumption behind the idea that Trump should be allowed on the ballot and that the public should have the chance to choose for or against him yet again is that he will respect the voice of the electorate. But we know this isn’t true. It wasn’t true after the 2016 presidential election — when, after winning the Electoral College, he sought to delegitimize the popular vote victory of his opponent as fraud — and it was put into stark relief after the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Trump is not simply a candidate who does not believe in the norms, values and institutions we call American democracy — although that is troubling enough. Trump is all that and a former president who used the power of his office to try to overturn constitutional government in the United States.</p><p>Is it anti-democratic to disqualify Trump from office and deny him a place on the ballot? Does it violate the spirit of democratic life to deny voters the choice of a onetime officeholder who tried, under threat of violence, to deny them their right to choose? Does it threaten the constitutional order to use the clear text of the Constitution to hold a former constitutional officer accountable for his efforts to overturn that order?</p><p>The answer is no, of course not. There is no rule that says democracies must give endless and unlimited grace to those who used the public trust to conspire, for all the world to see, against them. Voters are free to choose a Republican candidate for president; they are free to choose a Republican with Trump’s politics. But if we take the Constitution seriously, then Trump, by dint of his own actions, should be off the board.</p><p>Not that he will be. The best odds are that the Supreme Court of the United States will punt the issue of Section 3 in a way that allows Trump to run on every ballot in every state. And while it will be tempting to attribute this outcome to the ideological composition of the court — as well as the fact that Trump appointed three of its nine members — I think it will, if it happens, have as much to do with the zone of exception that exists around the former president.</p><p>If Trump has a political superpower, it’s that other people believe he has political superpowers. They believe that any effort to hold him accountable will backfire. They believe that he will always ride a wave of backlash to victory. They believe that challenging him on anything other than his terms will leave him stronger than ever.</p><p>Most of this is false. But to the extent that it is true, it has less to do with the missed shots — to borrow an aphorism from professional sports — than it does with the ones not taken in the first place.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/opinion/trump-insurrections-disqualification-14th-amendment.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'No. 10 Arizona runs away from Utah men’s basketball team, 93-72',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'No. 10 Arizona runs away from Utah men’s basketball team, 93-72'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/06/no-10-arizona-runs-away-utah-mens/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/06/no-10-arizona-runs-away-utah-mens/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/06/no-10-arizona-runs-away-utah-mens/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Salt Lake Tribune'}],\n   'author': 'The Salt Lake Tribune',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Salt Lake Tribune'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 04:25:55 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=4, tm_min=25, tm_sec=55, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"No. 10 Arizona pulled away in the second half and beat Utah 92-73 in a Pac-12 men's basketball game Saturday in Tucson.\",\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': \"No. 10 Arizona pulled away in the second half and beat Utah 92-73 in a Pac-12 men's basketball game Saturday in Tucson.\"},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>The No. 10 Arizona men’s basketball team dominated the second half and beat Utah 92-73 in a Pac-12 game Saturday evening in Tucson, Ariz.</p><p>The Runnin’ Utes trailed 42-39 at halftime.

Flight attendants helped them move to the other side of the plane a few minutes later, she said. The boy appeared to have lost his shirt, and his skin looked red and irritated, she added.</p><p>“It was honestly horrifying,” she said. “I almost broke down, but I realized I needed to remain calm.”</p><p>There were announcements over the speaker system, but none were audible because the wind whipping through the plane was so loud, she said. After the plane landed, paramedics came on board to ask whether anyone was injured, she added. A man seated in the row immediately behind the hole said that he had hurt his foot.</p><p>Le said the passengers were not given an explanation of what had happened. In a video she took of the flight, passengers can be heard clapping after landing. “Oh my god,” someone says.</p><p>After landing, Le said that she and her friends were boarding another flight to Ontario later that night.</p><p>Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 departed for Ontario International Airport at 5:07 p.m. and was diverted back to Portland six minutes later, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website. It reached a maximum altitude of about 16,000 feet, when its speed was recorded at more than 440 mph, and landed in Portland at 5:27 p.m.</p><p>The cause of the midair problem was unclear as of early Saturday. Keith Tonkin, managing director of Aviation Projects, an aviation consulting company in Brisbane, Australia, said that an excessive difference in the air pressure inside versus outside the cabin could have caused the wall to break off.</p><p>Passengers were probably able to breathe normally even when the plane was at its highest altitude, Tonkin added.</p><p>The plane was new, having been certified in November, according to the FAA registry of aircraft.

This time, though, Mendenhall’s support largely held across the city.</p><p>Burbank said the mayor benefited from incumbency, a particularly important advantage in local elections because voters typically don’t use party politics (the mayoral race is officially nonpartisan) to decide which candidate to support.</p><p>“You’re seen in that office. You have the chance to be seen around the city in a variety of groups, in a variety of settings, by people as the mayor,” he said, “So it’s very easy for people to say, ‘Yep, looks like the mayor’s doing fine.

It’s very calming.”</p><p>From her high school days onward, Hermie said she knew she wanted someday to have her own shop. As she learned more about coffee, particularly specialty coffees, her interest only grew.</p><p>When she was 21, she pursued that dream by moving to Boston, and spent eight years in the industry — at such Boston-area coffee chains as <a href=\"https://shop.thinkingcup.com/\">Thinking Cup</a> and <a href=\"https://georgehowellcoffee.com/\">George Howell Coffee</a>.</p><p>Jake grew up in Queens, where he drank deli coffee. Like Hermie, Jake didn’t get into specialty coffee until his early 20s.</p><p>“I’m the type of person who, when I’m interested in something, I go full on,” Jake said. “After college, I knew that I didn’t want to work in the office space.

It also made sense to start a business somewhere the density of coffee shops isn’t as strong as on the East Coast.</p><p>“[There’s] a lot of potential for growth out here, too,” Hermie said.</p><p>The name of their shop is tied to their relationship: Loki was a cat, their first pet together.</p><img alt=\"(Bethany Baker  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Patrons sit inside Loki Coffee in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023.\" height=\"2375\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/b-GcWabkN7G5M-KPfjpY1bP0Duo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/GCL2A52CCFG3JK7BEQTBV44R4Q.jpg\" width=\"3500\" /><br /><caption>(Bethany Baker  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Patrons sit inside Loki Coffee in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023.

The food menu focuses on toast, but they’re working on broadening the options.</p><p>The pour-over menu — where the hot water is poured directly over the coffee grounds — is Hermie’s favorite, because “it’s a rotating pour-over menu, so it’s not going to be the same every time,” she said. “When you get it [to drink in the shop], you get the whole experience: The board, a double-wall cup and a little postcard that has more information about the coffee.

They went to the event, and got to know the company — and realized their goals aligned.</p><p>“They’re a local roaster that focuses on single-sourcing all the beans, and having a direct relationship with the farmer,” Jake said. “[It’s] a mutually beneficial relationship, instead of going yourself to a third party and having them take the cut.”</p><p>The Hes, Jake said, want to make sure the coffee industry is sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>“We believe the more consumers are educated, the better the industry will be, because then they understand what makes a cup of coffee,” Jake said. “Why pay for a $5 cup of coffee when you can get it at a gas station for $1.99? What is the difference?”</p><p>Everything about coffee, he said, goes back to the farmers who grow the beans.</p><img alt=\"(Bethany Baker  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Jake He, co-owner of Loki Coffee, pours milk into a latte at his new coffeehouse in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023.\" height=\"2694\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/5c_QiXUa3oi3FJe2aIkjVgwjceY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/2OV4AR3FOBBFTPD45S4TTPK2H4.jpg\" width=\"3500\" /><br /><caption>(Bethany Baker  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Jake He, co-owner of Loki Coffee, pours milk into a latte at his new coffeehouse in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023.

They can continue to work on the farm that’s been passed on to them from their ancestors,” Jake said. “By focusing on quality over quantity, [we can] raise that awareness.”</p><p>Idle Hands — launched by three Australians who got together during the COVID-19 pandemic when their old employer’s U.S. operation shut down — works with producers all over the world, said co-founder Ricky Dyson. That includes growers in Colombia, El Salvador, Brazil and Ethiopia, and they work with an intermediary in Tanzania.</p><p>Dyson said when the Hes came to the company’s cupping, and then came back the next day to chat more, he saw their shared principles and values — particularly in their attitude about sustainability.</p><p>“It doesn’t take a big commitment for us to go that extra mile to find recyclable packaging or trading coffee,” Dyson said. “There’s a lot of things that people can do that don’t take a lot of effort, energy or expense.”</p><p>Dyson said it’s important to build up equity in the industry, from producer to barista — and partnering with Loki takes that idea downstream, from the barista to the customer.</p><p>“At the end of the day,” Hermie He said, “coffee is subjective.

It would then be up to the district to determine if the instructional material constitutes a violation of state laws regarding pornography. Districts must consider if the material has “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” which requires an incredibly subjective evaluation that school districts have disagreed on as recently as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/10/23/we-looked-banned-books-utahs/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>.

Teachers use content-specific and <a href=\"https://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/utahcorestandards\" target=\"_blank\">state board-approved core standards</a> to guide their instruction and selection of curriculum so it’s easy to search for what big ideas or skills students will be expected to learn. They often post assignments, readings and slides online for students (or parents) to access on platforms such as Canvas. Parents can also closely follow their student’s attendance, assignments and grades using online student information systems such as Power School or Skyward.</p><p>When the legislative session rolls around, if you see a bill that purports to improve our education system by regulating or micromanaging the daily work of teachers, making our schools more “transparent,” or removing materials that experienced, professional teachers and librarians have selected in alignment with school values and state standards, ask the teachers in your community how they feel about it. It is likely that the bills will be designed to solve a problem that doesn’t exist and will create significantly more work, stress, and unnecessary red tape for teachers and schools. Then, speak up as a parent and say these bills are not what our state needs.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>If you have a question or concern about something your child is learning, you can email the teacher and ask about it.

There are innumerable cases of more serious forms of misconduct — such as the falsification and fabrication of data — that have stained the reputations of universities all over the world. If academia really wants to tackle the problem, it’s got to rethink the way it judges and rewards research — and tell good from bad.</p><p>In Claudine Gay’s case, the plagiarism — and I think it qualifies as plagiarism — seems a venial sin rather than a mortal one. Yes, her doctoral dissertation and several of her academic papers appear to duplicate the language of other scholars in a way that fails to give sufficient credit. But that in itself isn’t irredeemable; when a couple of punctuation marks or a footnote can be all that separates vice from virtue, there’s a lot of room for interpretation and for honest error. However, plagiarism is a signifier of potentially much more damning sloppiness: Even when, as here, it isn’t an egregious case of trying to claim credit for someone else’s ideas, it can be a sign that the work has more fundamental problems. It’s a signal to advisers and peers to give that work extra scrutiny, scrutiny that is sadly lacking.</p><p>This is a huge issue because those same advisers and peers are the ones who determine the value — or lack of it — of research, largely through their role in publishing it. The coin of the realm in academia is typically the peer-reviewed paper; an academic gets credit for the research she performs when she publishes the results in a scholarly journal. For the most part, these journals will do a quick assessment of a paper’s worthiness and then send the manuscript out to a small number of subject-matter experts (often three) to gauge the quality and importance of the work. But peer reviewers have little incentive to do a thorough job. While universities richly reward a professor’s own research output, they care almost nothing about their professors’ role in checking others’ work. Nor are academics typically paid by the journals (which make money from publishing researchers’ work); and, given the imperfect anonymity of the process, a thorough, critical review can even damage the researcher’s relationship with other scientists. As a result, countless professors, when asked to perform a peer review for a journal, fob the work off to their hapless grad students, so it’s often not the seasoned academic judging the quality of research but the greenest in the field. And given the proliferation of academic journals — and the increase in the number of academic papers published each year — the academic review process is getting more threadbare by the year.</p><p>A truly thorough review of Dr. Gay’s papers by peers should have caught the plagiarism; spot-checking every single citation in a paper takes time, but it’s a great way of catching not just plagiarism but errors in interpretation. And that’s the easy stuff. Falsification or fabrication of data is even harder to catch, but it can often be detected given enough time and effort: Another college president, Stanford’s Marc Tessier-Lavigne, resigned after it was revealed that his lab published reports with manipulated data. (A review of the allegations said there was no evidence that Dr. Tessier-Lavigne knowingly falsified data, but that his work “fell below customary standards of scientific rigor and process.”) The problems were evident in the papers published in journals — and should have raised flags earlier.</p><p>And when those flags are raised, it’s incumbent upon academic institutions — and journals — to pay more attention than they presently do. There are countless credible accusations of misconduct that go uncorrected; I myself have published articles challenging the integrity of hundreds of papers. The majority of them have not been retracted, corrected or even remarked upon. I would wager that most reasonably large universities (my own included) have faculty members who are known to have plagiarized, fabricated, falsified, claimed undue credit, hidden financial conflicts of interest or misbehaved in numerous other ways and who have seemingly gone unpunished.</p><p>No review process is perfect; not only will lots of sloppy problems remain untidied before publication, but also some seriously shoddy research will always slip through. And the way academics are incentivized — trapped in a system that rewards them for how much they produce, but not for how much time they spend ensuring quality control in the field — virtually guarantees that the process will be inadequate. A more rigorous look at Dr. Gay’s work, especially early in her career, could have saved her and her field from future embarrassment. Which is a shame: Her critics never really challenge the core ideas that she put forth in her research; instead, they only chipped away at the edges of her work, leaving the fundamentals intact. After weeks of attacks, we haven’t heard much debate about her findings about, say, how increased African American representation in Congress affects voter attitudes; most of the questions were about whether her citations were done properly. If anything, this suggests that her work is not merely credible, but solid. After all, her scholarship has gotten a lot more scrutiny than that of the vast majority of academics on the planet, and no one has inflicted a mortal wound on any of her papers.</p><p>Flaws in Dr. Gay’s work, regardless of whether they’re fundamental, emerged when people looked closely at her writing. It would have been much better for her, not to mention Harvard, if those people had been her academic peers rather than her political enemies. But even as academics find themselves increasingly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/business/media/nikole-hannah-jones-unc.html\">caught</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/opinion/chris-rufo-florida-ron-desantis.html\">in</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/opinion/university-presidents-antisemitism.html\">political</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/upenn-law-professor-racism-freedom-speech.html\">battles</a>, there’s no movement to incentivize better quality control. Software won’t come to the rescue; plagiarism detectors (and artificial intelligence detectors, for that matter) don’t work very well, and, especially in a specialized field, it takes human eyes and human brains to untangle knotty questions of provenance and attribution. Whether it’s universities explicitly recognizing good peer reviews as a necessary service or journals rewarding academics who do solid review work, or even professors making a conscious effort to learn and teach how to do a deep and systematic review of a colleague’s research paper, academics have to recognize that only they can figure out how to keep their credibility intact.</p><p>That credibility rests on the ability to produce research — original research. Any would-be initiate to academe has to write a thesis compelling and novel enough to prove herself capable of original thought in her field. That’s what makes an accusation of plagiarism so serious in academia, and why academics have got to do a much better job of keeping it out of the ivory tower.</p><p><b>Charles Seife</b><i> is a professor at New York University and the author of seven books, including, most recently, “Hawking Hawking: The Selling of a Scientific Celebrity.”</i> <i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/opinion/plagiarism-academia-claudine-gay.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Energy Fuels ramps up uranium mining in La Sal',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Energy Fuels ramps up uranium mining in La Sal'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/01/06/energy-fuels-ramps-up-uranium/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/01/06/energy-fuels-ramps-up-uranium/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/2024/01/06/energy-fuels-ramps-up-uranium/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Gwen Dilworth | The Times-Independent'}],\n   'author': 'Gwen Dilworth | The Times-Independent',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Gwen Dilworth | The Times-Independent'},\n   'published': 'Sat, 06 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=6, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=6, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'Colorado-based Energy Fuels announced Dec. 21 that it has commenced uranium production at three mines, including two locations in San Juan County.

For weeks, both I and the institution to which I’ve devoted my professional life have been under attack. My character and intelligence have been impugned. My commitment to fighting antisemitism has been questioned. My inbox has been flooded with invective, including death threats. I’ve been called the N-word more times than I care to count.</p><p>My hope is that by stepping down I will deny demagogues the opportunity to further weaponize my presidency in their campaign to undermine the ideals animating Harvard since its founding: excellence, openness, independence, truth.</p><p>As I depart, I must offer a few words of warning. The campaign against me was about more than one university and one leader. This was merely a single skirmish in a broader war to unravel public faith in pillars of American society. Campaigns of this kind often start with attacks on education and expertise, because these are the tools that best equip communities to see through propaganda. But such campaigns don’t end there. Trusted institutions of all types — from public health agencies to news organizations — will continue to fall victim to coordinated attempts to undermine their legitimacy and ruin their leaders’ credibility. For the opportunists driving cynicism about our institutions, no single victory or toppled leader exhausts their zeal.</p><p>Yes, I made mistakes. In my initial response to the atrocities of Oct. 7, I should have stated more forcefully what all people of good conscience know: Hamas is a terrorist organization that seeks to eradicate the Jewish state. And at a congressional hearing last month, I fell into a well-laid trap. I neglected to clearly articulate that calls for the genocide of Jewish people are abhorrent and unacceptable and that I would use every tool at my disposal to protect students from that kind of hate.</p><p>Most recently, the attacks have focused on my scholarship. My critics found instances in my academic writings where some material duplicated other scholars’ language, without proper attribution. I believe all scholars deserve full and appropriate credit for their work. When I learned of these errors, I promptly requested corrections from the journals in which the flagged articles were published, consistent with how I have seen similar faculty cases handled at Harvard.</p><p>I have never misrepresented my research findings, nor have I ever claimed credit for the research of others. Moreover, the citation errors should not obscure a fundamental truth: I proudly stand by my work and its impact on the field.</p><p>Despite the obsessive scrutiny of my peer-reviewed writings, few have commented on the substance of my scholarship, which focuses on the significance of minority office holding in American politics. My research marshaled concrete evidence to show that when historically marginalized communities gain a meaningful voice in the halls of power, it signals an open door where before many saw only barriers. And that, in turn, strengthens our democracy.</p><p>Throughout this work, I asked questions that had not been asked, used then-cutting-edge quantitative research methods and established a new understanding of representation in American politics. This work was published in the nation’s top political science journals and spawned important research by other scholars.</p><p>Never did I imagine needing to defend decades-old and broadly respected research, but the past several weeks have laid waste to truth. Those who had relentlessly campaigned to oust me since the fall often trafficked in lies and ad hominem insults, not reasoned argument. They recycled tired racial stereotypes about Black talent and temperament. They pushed a false narrative of indifference and incompetence.</p><p>It is not lost on me that I make an ideal canvas for projecting every anxiety about the generational and demographic changes unfolding on American campuses: a Black woman selected to lead a storied institution. Someone who views diversity as a source of institutional strength and dynamism. Someone who has advocated a modern curriculum that spans from the frontier of quantum science to the long-neglected history of Asian Americans. Someone who believes that a daughter of Haitian immigrants has something to offer to the nation’s oldest university.</p><p>I still believe that. As I return to teaching and scholarship, I will continue to champion access and opportunity, and I will bring to my work the virtue I discussed <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/president/speeches/2023/courage-to-be-harvard/\">in the speech</a> I delivered at my presidential inauguration: courage. Because it is courage that has buoyed me throughout my career and it is courage that is needed to stand up to those who seek to undermine what makes universities unique in American life.</p><p>Having now seen how quickly the truth can become a casualty amid controversy, I’d urge a broader caution: At tense moments, every one of us must be more skeptical than ever of the loudest and most extreme voices in our culture, however well organized or well connected they might be. Too often they are pursuing self-serving agendas that should be met with more questions and less credulity.</p><p>College campuses in our country must remain places where students can learn, share and grow together, not spaces where proxy battles and political grandstanding take root. Universities must remain independent venues where courage and reason unite to advance truth, no matter what forces set against them.</p><p><b>Claudine Gay</b><i> is a former president of Harvard University, where she is a professor of government and of African and African American studies.

The cat’s natural habitat are the grasslands and savannas of southern Africa, and the felines are referred to as “ant-hill tigers” in the Afrikaans language, said Bob Cisneros, the zoo’s associate director of animal care.</p><p>Black-footed cats are considered the deadliest cats in the world — with a hunting success rate of over 60%, compared to the 25% success rate of their big-cat relatives, Cisneros said.

He will reside in his own bachelor pad next door to Gaia’s enclosure until she reaches sexual maturity and settles into her new Utah home.</p><p>Gaia arrived at the Hogle Zoo in October, but was quarantined for a while when she first moved in — as is customary for all new animals, so they can undergo a full health check and adjust after travel, Cisneros said.</p><p>“She’s on loan from the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas,” Cisneros added. “They have a very successful breeding program there. We sent somebody out the Fossil Rim a couple of years ago to really study their breeding program and work with the curatorial staff there, so that we can come back and emulate that.”</p><p>For now, Gaia will stay in her own personal temperate habitat inside the zoo’s small animal building. She won’t get much larger — according to the <a href=\"https://www.sanbi.org/animal-of-the-week/black-footed-cat/\" target=\"_blank\">South African National Biodiversity Institute</a>, the cats usually weigh about 4.4 lbs and grow to about a 1 foot, 6 inches long.</p><p>In the wild, the tenacious cats mostly feed on rodents, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and spiders — with females typically seeking out smaller prey than males to avoid competition, according to the <a href=\"https://www.sanbi.org/animal-of-the-week/black-footed-cat/\" target=\"_blank\">South African National Biodiversity Institute</a>. </p><p>Cisneros said Gaia will feed on a specific diet of ground bone, skeletal muscle and organs here — along with the occasional mouse that’s already been humanely euthanized through the zoo’s distributors.</p><p>Though Gaia is objectively cute, Cisneros cautioned she’s still a threat.</p><p>“Black-footed cats do not make pets. Wild animals do not make good pets,” Cisneros said. “It takes specialized staff to feed and care for an animal like this, knowing that she is a very successful hunter in the wild.”</p><p>“They have a reputation for being a very fierce cat,” he continued, “pound for pound.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'The best cocktail in Salt Lake?

There’s so much more to see and more people to meet.”</p><p>It’s safe to say that’s no problem after her year-long adventure.</p><p>That’s because Vallarta — whose day job is hosting the <a href=\"https://saltlake.citycast.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">City Cast Salt Lake podcast</a> — decided at the beginning of 2023 that she was going to do something a little crazy: grab a drink at every bar in Salt Lake County.</p><p>She drank at 211 bars in all.</p><p>The tour would be a bit of a logistical challenge. Sure, bars near her downtown Salt Lake City apartment would be relatively easy to pick off. But watering holes farther away required friendly designated drivers, geographic travel optimization, and, well, a lot of drinking.</p><p>Here’s a map of Vallarta’s 2023 journey. Dots on the map pop up to represent when in the year Vallarta visited each bar around the county.</p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p>She started out slowly, with those bars closer to her home. She didn’t hit the 50-bar mark until the end of April, but a late flourish of 83 bars visited in October, November and December ensured success before the year′s last call.</p><p>As Salt Lake’s foremost bar tourist, what can Vallarta teach us from her travels? Here’s what she said about her experiences — and Utah’s bar scene as a whole.</p><p>What makes a good bar?</p><p>Disappointingly, Vallarta declined to answer my obvious question.</p><p>“What’s the best bar in Salt Lake?”</p><p>She didn’t rank all 211 bars, which does feel understandable, and didn’t want to get into the cutthroat world of comparing these small businesses. <a href=\"https://saltlake.citycast.fm/best/the-best-salt-lake-bars-for-every-occasion\" target=\"_blank\">She has favorites for different occasions</a>: a first date (Junior’s), an anniversary (Bar Nohm or Sayonara), or a night at a dive (Bongo or Club 48).</p><p>But Vallarta said that there was clear continuity in her favorite bars, different types though they may be:</p><p>“A great bar is so clear in its identity, that when you walk in, you know what’s expected of you,” she said. “How to behave, and what is being offered, and what is not being offered. A bad bar is a bar without a clear identity.”</p><p>And most of all, through her conversations with people around the valley, she found another commonality:</p><p>“A key takeaway from this journey is that the best bar is the one closest to you,” she said.</p><p>Do the bars feel safe?</p><p>Another question that Vallarta said she heard frequently: “Did you ever feel unsafe during your quest?”</p><p>She said she didn’t — that “not once” did she feel either unsafe or even unwelcomed at the bar she was at. She acknowledges that her project’s usual modus operandi, popping into a bar for a drink or two, might have led to different feelings than for someone who stayed longer. Bad things do sometimes happen at bars.</p><img alt=\"(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.\" height=\"4032\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/OKk7979wFMWrya3jmMKBixQJC_I=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/PY7K4R3KNBCT5B4P4YRG2GR4PU.jpg\" width=\"3024\" /><br /><caption>(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.</caption><p>But in general, she felt that some bars just got a bad rap from people who didn’t know better.</p><p>“I think the implication of that question is — were these places seedy?” Vallarta said. “I went to a lot of dive bars, and I didn’t really meet seedy people, I met people who just think that the best bar is the one closest to their house.”</p><p>Bar staff deserved a lot of credit, too.</p><p>“I would attribute never feeling unsafe to how lucky we are to have really great bartenders and bouncers in Salt Lake County. I’m not just talking about your favorite door guy you know,” Vallarta said. “I’m talking about — when I went to the Second Amendment-themed bar in Herriman ... they could not have been more welcoming.”</p><p>What’s the best drink in Salt Lake County?</p><p>OK, Vallarta couldn’t try every drink in the county — nor did she really try to. But especially at Salt Lake County’s cocktail bars, she asked bartenders to recommend the best drinks they had available.</p><p>And one stood out: Seabird’s “Nine Post Cards” cocktail. At locations in Draper and the Gateway in Salt Lake City, Seabird’s bartenders make the drink with Suntory’s Haku vodka, pear liqueur, sesame miso syrup, and lemon juice. The cocktail costs a pricey $14. Still, she says it was worth it.</p><p>“It was divine,” Vallarta says. “It’s hard to say because sometimes you taste something delicious, and it’s also about the moment, what you ate an hour before, what you’re in the mood for. But this was just a good a-- drink.”</p><p>Notable bar crawls</p><p>In order to accomplish her goal, Vallarta organized many of her bar trips into weekend bar crawls, in which she’d visit establishments in a particular location or with a particular theme. These days became some of the highlights of the year.</p><p>• First, she says, was her Fourth of July bar crawl in Magna, which featured five different establishments.</p><p>“The Fourth of July in Magna is tremendous,” Vallarta said. “There’s a bustle about it. There’s a chaos about it. ... People are just down to clown. When you’re in Magna, you’re almost like ‘Are we in Nevada?’”</p><img alt=\"(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.\" height=\"2932\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/_CwqDhkNekodOHbvvujjDLOQwvs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/VOD4UUDTZJGU5PUPN66EWZOUF4.jpg\" width=\"3022\" /><br /><caption>(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.</caption><p>• Another notable trip: the Saturday she visited all nine ‘Bout Time Pub &amp; Grub establishments in the county. A large group of friends and even just curious acquaintances joined the shenanigans. The chain is by far the most ubiquitous bar in the valley. Vallarta says that the ‘Bout Time location in West Valley City near the Maverik Center is the best one of the bunch.</p><p>• She organized two crawls in which she visited bars that aren’t open to the general public — those at country clubs and those for veterans. Sometimes, those clubs opened their doors when Vallarta explained her resolution, at others, she found a club member who “sponsored” her for a day.</p><p>The impact of Utah’s liquor laws</p><p>One of Vallarta’s most interesting takeaways was how Utah’s liquor laws impacted bars’ successes or failures.</p><p>First, Vallarta noted a relative lack of neighborhood bars. Because state regulations prohibit bars from being near churches, schools, libraries, parks, and playgrounds, they tend to be pushed to unusual places, or bigger retail developments — ironically, farther away from where people are likely to live. As a result, not many people can walk to a neighborhood bar outside of downtown Salt Lake City.</p><p>But Utah’s strict limit on the number of bar licenses available — one for every 10,200 residents — also had an impact on the character of new bars that open, Vallarta believes.</p><p>In short, the DABS only gives licenses to bars that are ready to open immediately. As a result, new bar owners must pay rent, develop a space, hire staff, and have supplies ready for months before opening a bar — a huge initial expense. But bar owners can’t really advertise about a new bar opening, either, because there’s no known opening date.</p><p>“You definitely notice a difference between places that are long established and places that are new,” Vallarta said. “It almost feels like you need to have some sort of like a gimmick or a very specific identity — like you’re trying to become the talk of the town. You’re trying to generate more enthusiasm than I think is appropriate for any new business to have to generate while opening their doors and training.”</p><p>But while the bars themselves differ, Vallarta says there’s value to any bar in Utah.</p><p>“Especially in Utah, being a place where people can gather (is important),” Vallarta said. “It’s a third space, where people can gather and where it’s not unacceptable or rude or bothersome to strike up a conversation with a stranger. There’s a little bit of identity politics at play when you’re in a bar in the state, because right away, people start to make inferences about your lifestyle.”</p><p>It’s true — bargoers are a little rarer around here. But perhaps there’s a lesson there: the inside of every bar, no matter the zip code, has its own community, and perhaps those communities have more in common than you might anticipate.</p><p>Take it from someone who’s been to all of them.</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

Western water managers aren’t keen to pursue either of those options.</p><p>Reclamation will consider the states’ timely proposal as one of several options for managing the Colorado River in future decades as they undertake the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) steps for post-2026 operations. Haas said that she is optimistic about the states having a plan ready in time, despite the arduous months of negotiations ahead.</p><p>“If we want to control our destiny, if we want to have a stake in this, then we’ve got to put an alternative forth to be considered and evaluated,” Haas added.</p><p>When it comes to devising a plan to manage a river that sustains 40 million people, 30 tribes and many delicate ecosystems, there’s a lot to consider.</p><p>Serving as a disillusioning backdrop for negotiations is the fact that the Colorado River’s flows, which fill Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have decreased by 20% since the turn of the century. In the coming decades, water managers have to take the West’s hotter and drier climate into account.</p><p>“We’ve got to plan for the variability of hydrology, especially given climate change,” Haas said. “We have to have the tools and the flexibility to operate under a range of conditions. That’s the bottom line.”</p><p>Haas said that water negotiators are also considering<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/04/how-last-years-winter-continues/\" target=\"_blank\"> this winter’s lack of precipitation</a> in their discussions about the future.</p><p>The Upper Basin states (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) will also have to work with the states of the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada) to decide how to divide the river’s water — and how to conserve it. The Lower Basin states have already promised to cut their water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2023/12/15/californias-colorado-river-water/\" target=\"_blank\">part of a separate agreement</a> independent of post-2026 negotiations.</p><p>It’s also still unclear, at least to the public, how post-2026 operations will include the 30 federally recognized Native American tribes that call the Colorado River Basin home.</p><p>And even if the Colorado River Basin states get their plan to the Bureau of Reclamation in time, that doesn’t guarantee that federal officials will approve their plan. Reclamation could accept their plan wholesale, but the agency can also pick and choose different parts of the plan to approve at their discretion to develop different alternatives for post-2026 operations.</p><p>Reclamation wants to start modeling potential alternatives in April, Haas said, to publish a draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 operations by the end of 2024.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n\\n</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Utah gymnast Maile O’Keefe was not looking forward to her senior year.

I’m really pissed that I did that.”</p><p>More seriously, he reflected upon how one response he gave to Utah’s decision-makers perhaps proved a sliding-door moment.</p><p>“I kind of felt like in that interview, they asked me a particular question that I wasn’t quite ready to answer,” Mazzulla said. “It was like, ‘Do you think, at a young age, you can run an organization?’ And I knew I could, but I didn’t give off the answer that I needed to give to get the job.”</p><p>(Those two are currently the youngest head coaches in the NBA, with Hardy turning 36 years old in just over two weeks, and Mazzulla following suit in five more months.)</p><p>Mazzulla was subsequently asked if the Jazz had told him they found his answer lacking or if it was just something he intuited.</p><p>“I just felt that. I could just feel,” he said. “Not that they were wrong in that, by the way. They made the right choice in hiring Will, I want to be clear on that.”</p><p><i>So you’re not as good a coach as Will?</i> a reporter jokingly asked.</p><p>“No,” Mazzulla replied earnestly.</p><p>Just days before their 2022 training camp, the Celtics suspended Udoka for at least the 2022-23 season for violations of the team’s code of conduct.</p><p>When Mazzulla got an interview for what was then an interim promotion, he found his prior experience with the Jazz helpful this time around.</p><p>“Going through that process helped me articulate <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4324351/2023/03/19/danny-ainge-joe-mazzulla-jazz-celtics/\" target=\"_blank\">my strengths and what I think I can do</a>,” he said. “That was a good process to have to go through.”</p><p>After Mazzulla finished his pregame media session Friday, Hardy was asked how he handled that same query in his interview with the Jazz.</p><p>“I don’t know how that specific answer went — I didn’t get a report card after,” he replied dryly. “But I just tried to be as honest as possible, like, ‘I don’t have all the answers right now.’ I think when you’re young as a coach going into those interviews, there’s no reason to hide from those facts: Yes, I am young; yes, I’ve never been a head coach, but I think sometimes there’s strength in that. I’m not a finished product, I’m not rigid, I’m not walking in with a giant notebook that’s like, ‘Here’s my program, take it or leave it.’ I still don’t think I have all the answers.”</p><p>He would add that, as a mid-30s person now in his second year of his first-ever head coaching job, there’s still very much an acclimation process going on.</p><p>But he also feels like that’s a good thing.</p><p>“Leading an organization is hard, being in this seat is different than being an assistant in a thousand ways,” Hardy said. “You feel everything that happens, good or bad, in a very different way than when you’re an assistant. You feel a responsibility for not only the players, but you feel a responsibility for the people that you’ve hired and work with you every day.</p><p>“It’s something I’m still getting used to. I kind of hope I never fully get used to it,” he continued. “I think some of that anxiety or stress keeps you sharp — or it keeps <i>me</i> sharp. I do OK with some of that; you obviously don’t want to overload it, but it keeps me in the moment and keeps me on the next thing.”</p><p>The reflection bit over with, he naturally had to revert to sarcasm at the end.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll go back and ask [CEO Danny Ainge] what he thought of my answer,” Hardy said. “It’ll give us something to talk about.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Utah Jazz’s brutal stretch begins with a brutal loss in Boston',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Utah Jazz’s brutal stretch begins with a brutal loss in Boston'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/05/utah-jazzs-brutal-stretch-begins/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/05/utah-jazzs-brutal-stretch-begins/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/05/utah-jazzs-brutal-stretch-begins/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Eric Walden'}],\n   'author': 'Eric Walden',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Eric Walden'},\n   'published': 'Sat, 06 Jan 2024 09:01:15 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=6, tm_hour=9, tm_min=1, tm_sec=15, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=6, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"After a stretch of nine wins in 12 games, there was some thought that the Utah Jazz were finally turning a corner.

The shooting has been solid, especially at the rim. The implementation of some zone schemes has been productive (well, discounting Wednesday’s Detroit game).</p><p>And as a result, there certainly were some positive results heading into Friday’s matchup against the Celtics at TD Garden — notably, the season’s first three-game winning streak, and a stretch of nine victories in their past 12 games.</p><p>Those positive results, however, did not carry over into Friday.</p><p>The Jazz were obliterated 126-97 by the Celtics.</p><p>At one point in the first quarter, they were shooting 3 for 16. With their next make, they were 4 for 22. At the end of the first quarter, they were 5 for 27 overall, and 1 of 12 from 3.</p><p>A dream-sequence stretch of five consecutive made baskets late in the second quarter got Utah all the way up to 15 of 49 (30.6%) overall and 4 for 20 from 3 … and to within 71-40 on the scoreboard.</p><p>They wound up shooting 6 of 34 from beyond the arc for game.</p><p>And <i>now</i> for the bad news.</p><p>It doesn’t get any easier.</p><p>This part of the schedule is brutal. This road trip, at Boston, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee (with the first two on a back-to-back) is against the Eastern Conference’s top three teams. And while the Jazz follow that up with a six-game homestand, it begins against the reigning NBA champion Nuggets, who, after a somewhat slow start, have now worked their way up to a top-three spot in the West.</p><p>“I appreciate the nightmare fuel,” head coach Will Hardy deadpanned pregame when asked about the stretch.</p><p>While noting that his sole goal for Friday was to focus on and get through the Celtics game, the coach did concede that such a sequence of games might well be telling.</p><p>“Playing really good teams always tests you. We’ve been playing good basketball of late, but to go on the road and play high-level opponents in great, hard atmospheres is going to be really good for our group,” he said. “It’s going to test us both on the court from a physical standpoint and test our emotional and mental stability.</p><p>“The thing I’m probably most focused on over these next couple of games, is can we keep our heads when it doesn’t go well?” Hardy added. “… Can we withstand that and stick to what we’re trying to do and not go rogue?”</p><p>Well, not so much on this occasion. A 17-0 Boston run in the second quarter was pretty much the death knell.</p><p>“If we don’t start off physical and aggressive, that continues to follow us throughout the game,” said forward John Collins, who finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds.</p><p>Though what happened at the start of Friday’s game is certainly unique and anomalous to some degree, the end result nevertheless shows just how far the Jazz have to go in some areas.</p><p>The biggest one, per Hardy, is on-the-ball defense. While conceding that one-on-one defense in the NBA is incredibly difficult owing to both the talent level and the rules, he nevertheless argued that his players need to do better. Situational awareness must improve. So too must simple effort.</p><p>“Scheme is important, team defense is important, but I think it all starts with individual pride,” he said.</p><p>Offensively, the Jazz have become a team predicated upon off-ball movement, but must adapt to switching defenses by improving their efficacy in pick-and-roll scenarios, the coach said.</p><p>It wasn’t that none of that went to plan Friday.</p><p>The coach didn’t hate the way his team played at the beginning, even though they were missing a ton of shots. But as the hole started getting bigger, the habits started slipping.</p><p>“The games against the really good teams, they test your ability to recognize what’s real and what’s not, and what was a missed shot on a good execution play vs. what was a bad possession,” said Hardy. “Early in the game I thought we were doing pretty well with our execution — and then I thought it just slipped.”</p><p>Collins added that continuing to do all the little things, keeping the attention to detail tends to start faltering in those times.</p><p>“That’s probably some of the hardest basketball to play,” he said. “… Those are the moments that truly build character for us. It’s a corny cliché, but those are the hard moments we have to learn from.”</p><p>The third quarter was better, with Utah playing Boston to a near-draw, and seeing a 31-point halftime deficit only become a 32-point end-of-third-quarter deficit.</p><p>Several players noted postgame that they’d compounded their own misfortune before halftime by resorting to too much one-on-one play. They felt like they got back on track a bit after the break, even if the ultimate result wasn’t indicative of a ton of progress.</p><p>“Work through it as a team — nobody’s gonna climb back up from that kinda hole by themselves,” said Lauri Markkanen, who had 17 points, five rebounds, and five assists.</p><p>“Just try to cut the lead little by little and let’s not try to make the home-run plays — let’s do it together,” added Collin Sexton, who totaled 13 points. “When we’re playing together and doing it as one, you can tell the flow of the game was totally different.”</p><p>Hardy was pleased that the third quarter indicated that “we didn’t just lay down and die.” He didn’t make up for the game being all but over after 24 minutes.</p><p>Still, the Jazz get a chance to do it again Saturday against the 76ers.</p><p>Back-to-backs are no NBA player’s favorite occurrence. But the Jazz can’t help but look forward to this one, eager for a chance to right some wrongs.</p><p>“This is not a group that makes excuses. Our locker room, right now, is not happy with the performance tonight and is ready to get back out there tomorrow,” said Hardy.</p><p>“Oh yeah, definitely, especially just to wash this one down the drain,” said Sexton. “This one tomorrow is gonna be big.”</p><p>It probably will be.</p><p>Either the Jazz are going to bounce back and prove their recent run has not been a facade, that they are capable of delivering high-level performances against top opponents, or the notion that they were feasting on low-level foes and simply don’t have the capacity to hang with anyone better is going to get some heavy reinforcement.</p><p><br /></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Utah Red Rocks are changing their tunes and hoping to get fans more involved',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Utah Red Rocks are changing their tunes and hoping to get fans more involved'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/05/utah-red-rocks-are-changing-their/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/05/utah-red-rocks-are-changing-their/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/05/utah-red-rocks-are-changing-their/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Alex Vejar'}],\n   'author': 'Alex Vejar',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Alex Vejar'},\n   'published': 'Sat, 06 Jan 2024 05:31:35 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=6, tm_hour=5, tm_min=31, tm_sec=35, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=6, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'Utah Red Rocks fans might hear more familiar songs when they attend gymnastics meets this season.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Utah Red Rocks fans might hear more familiar songs when they attend gymnastics meets this season.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Inside Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, last April while college gymnasts from Oklahoma, Florida, Utah and Louisiana State tumbled, flipped and danced, the Red Rocks coaches took stock of what they could improve next season.

They’ll probably sing along to sophomore Makenna Smith’s all-1970s playlist that includes “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. They’ll probably jump around during fifth-year senior Jaedyn Rucker’s routine, which features a little House of Pain. They’ll probably delight in fifth-year senior Abby Paulson’s all-Taylor Swift routine.</p><p>Assistant coach Myia Hambrick said part of the reason for the shift in music this season was to cater more to the fans. Those who attend Utah gymnastics events generally skew older or are families with younger children, she said.</p><p>And when fans are done singing along, the Red Rocks hope their scores will have them cheering louder than ever.</p><p>Musical choices are integral during a floor routine — which only lasts a maximum of one minute, 30 seconds — because they dictate choreography. Dockendorf said she felt this season could include songs that were “more interesting” musically than the previous year. She wanted more opportunities for her gymnasts to have more fun and be more creative.</p><p>“We really do try to give the athletes say in their music because it’s important that they like it,” Dockendorf said. “Otherwise, they won’t be able to move to it very well.”</p><img alt=\"(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jaedyn Rucker performs her floor routine during the fourth-annual Rio Tinto Best of Utah gymnastics meet between Brigham Young University, Southern Utah University, Utah State University and the University of Utah at the Maverik Center, Jan. 13, 2023.\\n\" height=\"2230\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/UWsPvquF_expMjOzxb4t-J-9u0g=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/HTQ5UWYTCJF2TCX2T74JFEX22Y.jpg\" width=\"2880\" /><br /><caption>(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jaedyn Rucker performs her floor routine during the fourth-annual Rio Tinto Best of Utah gymnastics meet between Brigham Young University, Southern Utah University, Utah State University and the University of Utah at the Maverik Center, Jan. 13, 2023.\\n (Leah Hogsten/)</caption><p>Music changes from year to year are somewhat common in gymnastics as athletes hone techniques and dance moves over time. But the shift for the Red Rocks this season “definitely feels different,” Paulson said.</p><p>“We’ve been a more traditional team in the past floor music wise,” Paulson said. “Where I feel like this year, we have actually expanded to fit our routines [to] our personality instead of trying to fit our personality to our routine, if that makes sense.”</p><p>The quest for some new tunes started quickly after the 2022-23 season ended. Hambrick, who is a former gymnast at LSU and in her third season coaching with the Red Rocks, said the process took “months,” and that every coach and gymnast was constantly with ears open for songs that might work. She was inspired by “Jump Around” while on a trip to Korea, she said.</p><p>Part of the process that takes so long, Dockendorf added, is finding tracks no one else has. What happens often, she said, is someone will find a song only to discover another school uses that exact song or a version of it.</p><p>The Red Rocks enlisted the help of Troy Sales, an audio content producer who has worked on various projects within the state and beyond, including BYU gymnastics and the popular local halftime act Jean’s Golden Girls. Sales started working on music mixes for the Red Rocks in 2019, and he did the music for every gymnast on the roster this season.</p><p>While Sales doesn’t choose any music for Utah, a big part of his job is to make his mixes upbeat and dynamic. He does so by speeding up parts of a song, or adding sounds like cymbals, bass drops, transitions and other pieces of “extra flair,” he said.</p><img alt=\"(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Makenna Smith celebrates her floor routine as Utah hosts California, NCAA gymnastics in Salt Lake City on Friday, Feb. 24, 2023.\" height=\"1867\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/vPHFRkykv7sY58xASA2e-l48xHw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/LW3JUSY4DJBTZOTUAG4V46I4JI.jpg\" width=\"2800\" /><br /><caption>(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Makenna Smith celebrates her floor routine as Utah hosts California, NCAA gymnastics in Salt Lake City on Friday, Feb. 24, 2023.

She said she liked the idea of building a routine with those songs because she enjoys watching videos of people dancing in clubs to them.</p><p>“She wants to be out there, she wants to do something a little bit out of the box,” Dockendorf said of Smith. “That’s kind of what ’70s music is — it’s different. Someone with Makenna’s personality could do a routine to that, whereas someone maybe who’s a little more reserved wouldn’t get into a ’70s-style-themed routine.”</p><p>To top it off, Smith is looking forward to showcasing her routine in front of fans specifically for the music.</p><p>“For me personally, I was really excited this year that I felt my music allowed me to kind of engage with the crowd more,” Smith said. “Even if you don’t really know ’70s music, you know what ‘Stayin’ Alive’ is. It’s pretty easy to recognize. So I thought that was super fun.”</p><p>Hambrick hopes the musical changes will allow gymnasts to enjoy their routines more due to the floor event’s need for high energy.</p><p>“It is a very demanding event,” Hambrick said. “So the more fun you’re having, and the more you’re able to loosen up and just kind of let yourself do your gymnastics, usually the better it turns out.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.
