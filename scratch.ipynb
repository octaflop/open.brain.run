Valley Forge is thus a sacred site in what has come to be known as the American civil religion.</p><p>To be sure, it wasn’t beside the point of Biden’s campaign kickoff that Pennsylvania is one of those swing states that will determine the outcome of the election in November.</p><p>Still, 100 miles west of Valley Forge, also in Pennsylvania, there’s another, even more sacred site where Jan. 6 resonates more loudly. The Gettysburg National Military Park commemorates not only the Union Army’s critical victory over the Southern rebellion, but also the most famous endorsement of the American experiment ever given by a president, Abraham Lincoln’s <a href=\"https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm\">Gettysburg Address</a>.</p><img alt=\"(AP file image) This undated illustration depicts President Abraham Lincoln making his Gettysburg Address.\" height=\"1980\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/bs5dH_4H5_keT_FMqA462rzI7nQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/DV675DIWRNGPNDFEV444YXUYOU.jpg\" width=\"3000\" /><br /><caption>(AP file image) This undated illustration depicts President Abraham Lincoln making his Gettysburg Address.</caption><p>Speaking four months after the battle at the dedication of the Gettysburg military cemetery on Nov. 19, 1863, Lincoln declared that the soldiers who died had “consecrated” the battlefield so that “this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”</p><p>Talk about democracy as a sacred cause!</p><p>Lincoln also emphasized that it was “for us the living” to be “dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.” Whatever the larger implications of this statement, with the 1864 presidential election less than a year away it was also a campaign pitch — a plea by the Republican president to continue the war in the face of Democratic calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and Lincoln’s own concern that he would not be reelected.</p><p>In the event, of course, Lincoln won the election handily, though then as now Pennsylvania was a swing state and he carried it by just 3.5 percentage points.</p><p>Given all the parallels, I imagine there were those in the White House who urged Biden to give his speech in Gettysburg — to associate himself and his cause with Lincoln rather than Washington. In fact, he did give a nod to the Civil War when he spoke of “the mob that attacked the Capitol, waving Trump flags and Confederate flags.”</p><p>But he didn’t go to Gettysburg, and it’s not hard to understand why.</p><p>For starters, no president should risk putting his words up against Lincoln’s immortal prose.</p><p>More importantly, equating the Jan. 6 (or, more accurately, the post-2020-election) insurrection to the Civil War is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it brands the insurrection and its protagonist as anti-American. On the other, its vastly smaller scale invites critics to downplay its significance. Plus, with voters to attract in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, does Biden really want to be seen as refighting the War Between the States?</p><p>Finally, there’s the issue of <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/\">Section 3 of the 14th Amendment</a> barring insurrectionists who have taken an oath to support the Constitution from again holding office — passed after the Civil War to keep out of government former public officials who supported the Confederacy. If Biden thinks it applies to his predecessor, he has avoided directly saying so.</p><p>After the Colorado Supreme Court found Trump ineligible for office under Section 3 last month, Biden told a reporter there was “no question” that he was responsible for supporting an insurrection. “It’s self-evident,” he continued. “You saw it all. Now, whether the 14th Amendment applies, I’ll let the court make that decision.”</p><p>Perhaps not coincidentally, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its review of the Colorado case on the eve of Jan. 6, when Biden was giving his campaign speech at Valley Forge. If he’d given it at Gettysburg, he’d have seemed to be putting his thumb more forcibly on the scale.</p><p><i>(The views expressed in this opinion piece do not necessarily reflect those of Religion News Service.)</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Opinion: Press pause on animal shelter changes in Tooele',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Opinion: Press pause on animal shelter changes in Tooele'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/09/opinion-press-pause-animal-shelter/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/09/opinion-press-pause-animal-shelter/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/09/opinion-press-pause-animal-shelter/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Julie Castle | For The Salt Lake Tribune'}],\n   'author': 'Julie Castle | For The Salt Lake Tribune',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Julie Castle | For The Salt Lake Tribune'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 15:25:35 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=15, tm_min=25, tm_sec=35, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '“Implicitly encouraging pet abandonment as the only doorway to the shelter via the police makes no sense and puts another item on the plate of Tooele police when they presumably have more important things to do,” writes Julie Castle is the CEO of Best Friends Animal Society.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': '“Implicitly encouraging pet abandonment as the only doorway to the shelter via the police makes no sense and puts another item on the plate of Tooele police when they presumably have more important things to do,” writes Julie Castle is the CEO of Best Friends Animal Society.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>The City of Tooele has been at the forefront of animal welfare in Utah and across the country with <a href=\"https://bestfriends.org/no-kill-2025/animal-shelter-statistics/utah?:linktarget=_self&amp;:embed=yes\" target=\"_blank\">a nearly 90% save rate since 2020</a>. That means almost 90% of all dogs and cats coming into the shelter are leaving alive. This didn’t just happen. It was achieved through the hard work of a dedicated staff by implementing lifesaving programs and policies in the shelter, working collaboratively with rescue organizations and engaging with the community.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tooelecityanimalshelter/posts/pfbid02B7dhabfEPXLnk31m5k3dHBwCNsr32oCsEYbsZLmQvXmSrqf8fARLeJGgMyAonMw1l\" target=\"_blank\">On Dec. 12</a>, the city stated that, going forward, the shelter will only accept dogs and cats that come into the shelter via a police officer or an animal control officer. Judging from the reaction of community members, the decision appears to have been made without prior collaboration and communication with the public, and it devalues the lives of community pets.</p><p>In their announcement, the city referenced how this change would make public safety a priority. However, city leadership did not publicly cite any concerns, nor have they shared any data regarding public safety that would warrant the changes. At face value, the decision appears to be lacking insight into the community’s needs.</p><p>A humane community is a safe community, and the people of Tooele are justifiably proud to live in a place that values the lives of all family members, including pets. That is why we are asking city leaders to press pause on their recent decision to no longer operate a no-kill animal shelter. It’s not too late to take a step back and rethink this decision and avoid dismantling the hard work of so many and the accomplishment of the entire community.</p><p>Rather than accepting at-risk dogs and cats from the community, the city’s announcement encourages the public to reach out to local rescue groups and non-profit organizations for assistance. The rescue organizations that were working closely with the animal shelter are already stretched thin, doing a lot with a little. Most are without a brick-and-mortar facility and had zero input or consultation on the implementation of the change being made.</p><p>In a successful no-kill community that prioritizes public safety and humane animal care, community members, animal welfare nonprofits and the city government are all key players. They collaborate together to leverage each other’s resources and operating models to help prevent pet surrender, to save lives of pets entering the shelter and to combat cruelty and other public safety issues. No one entity can be asked to carry the entire burden but rather, it requires the type of collaboration and cooperation that has served the community so well to the present. Implicitly encouraging pet abandonment as the only doorway to the shelter via the police makes no sense and puts another item on the plate of Tooele police when they presumably have more important things to do.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>City leaders also reference being at capacity as a contributor to the decision to close the shelter to the public. This is something that could be addressed by incremental enhancement of the policies and procedures. There is plenty of local support for the animal shelter in bolstering critical programs. That is why it is so important to communicate with and include stakeholders on a decision that, if not paused and rethought, will have unintended negative consequences for the city.</p><p>By making this abrupt management and operations change, without communication or planning with the organizations that the city expects to step into the self-created void, gives the appearance that city leadership has turned its back on the community that helped create and support a lifesaving animal shelter operation.</p><p>There is a strong tie between lifesaving animal services, community wellbeing and public safety. Dismantling a system of operation that took years to create will cost innocent lives and cannot easily be undone. Nothing in this plan will create a safer community for the residents of Tooele.</p><p>Best Friends Animal Society is asking that Tooele’s leadership press pause on the changes and gather stakeholders and leadership together to take another look at what can be done to ensure that neither life saving animal sheltering nor public safety are compromised.</p><img alt=\"Julie Castle\" height=\"6720\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/dAE2z0nlt10ayrFCdt1pQ_uxjoU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/BR7WNDJJOBDNZAKBXVFMYB6TKE.jpg\" width=\"4480\" /><br /><caption>Julie Castle (Sarah Ause Kichas/)</caption><p><i><b>Julie Castle </b></i><i>is the CEO of Best Friends Animal Society.</i></p><p><i>The Salt Lake Tribune is committed to creating a space where Utahns can share ideas, perspectives and solutions that move our state forward.

This past year, Cox has turned his back on the LGBT community to score political points.He supported and signed legislation that harms transgender youth, neglected to mention the LGBTQ community in his 2022 Pride Proclamation, and attacked DEI programs at Utah’s colleges and universities as “evil.” With hate crimes against LGBTQ people on the rise and many elected officials in this state labeling our community as “groomers,” we need more leaders like 2016 Cox who are unafraid to call for unity and love.</p><p>Unfortunately, Cox has abandoned his compassion and integrity to more closely align with his political party and shore up his support for reelection. Cox circa 2016 no longer exists, or if he does, he certainly hasn’t been showing up. Will the real Spencer Cox please stand up? We need him to lead with compassion, integrity, and courage to stand up for the LGBTQ community in Utah.</p><p><i>Jacob Newman, Millcreek</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/09/08/how-share-your-opinion-with-salt/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Submit a letter to the editor</i></a></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Gordon Monson: LDS Church owns most of the land around Temple Square, but does it own the heart of SLC, too?',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Gordon Monson: LDS Church owns most of the land around Temple Square, but does it own the heart of SLC, too?'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/gordon-monson-lds-church-owns-most/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/gordon-monson-lds-church-owns-most/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/gordon-monson-lds-church-owns-most/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Gordon Monson'}],\n   'author': 'Gordon Monson',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Gordon Monson'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Tribune columnist Gordon Monson on the LDS Church's future ideas for expanding and renovating Temple Square.\",\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': \"Tribune columnist Gordon Monson on the LDS Church's future ideas for expanding and renovating Temple Square.\"},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>As an <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/07/16/lds-church-its-way-becoming/\">enormously wealthy church</a> considers what to do with its landholdings in downtown Salt Lake City, specifically in the blocks around its centerpiece temple, I have some ideas.</p><p>Don’t we all.</p><p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shelved an initial draft proposal, recently reported in <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/12/31/lds-temple-square-tomorrow-could/\">The Salt Lake Tribune</a>, but that doesn’t mean some of those ideas might not be actualized in some way at some time in the years ahead. Will it be the massive “Mountain of the Lord” endeavor discussed in the 107-page document, complete with a reconfiguring that puts a wrecking ball to the 28-story Church Office Building, the historic Church Administration Building and the classic Joseph Smith Memorial Building, while erecting new structures around a vast fountain-lined green space that would be a cross between the National Mall in Washington and the Catholic Church’s Vatican City in Rome?</p><p>Probably not. But don’t be surprised to see what a deep-pocketed religion might have in mind for land it owns in a town it owns in a state it owns — or, some say, thinks it owns. As church <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/10/31/this-week-mormon-land/\">President Russell Nelson was quoted</a> as saying a few years back, “Eat your vitamin pills. Get your rest. It’s going to be exciting.”</p><p>It might be expensive, too, to the tune of millions, maybe billions. No problem for a church that has plenty of cash. It already is drawing on its resources with the ongoing renovations on the Salt Lake Temple, an extensive undertaking meant to freshen the iconic structure and make it more efficient and seismically safe, all scheduled to be <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/03/26/reopening-historic-salt-lake-lds/\">completed in 2026</a>. Here’s to hoping the famous building’s classic interior won’t be severely altered to a more utilitarian model found in newer Latter-day Saint temples. Don’t spend a fortune transforming the temple from what it was into God’s version of a Marriott Hotel. Nothing wrong with preserving a little antiquated quirkiness in the faith’s marquee edifice.</p><p>It seems to be the church’s aim and ambition to make the center of its worldwide religion something to catch the eye and refresh the spirit of those — believers and nonbelievers alike — who take the time to drop in on its home base.</p><p>Let visitors inside the temple</p><img alt=\"(Francisco Kjolseth  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) The plaza at Temple Square is lit up for the holidays as people take in the visual delights in November 2023.

Tribune columnist Gordon Monson would like to see at least parts of the Salt Lake Temple opened to visitors after its renovated, reopened and rededicated. (Francisco Kjolseth/)</caption><p>The aforementioned proposal said the idea is to elevate the “guest experience” for those who trek to the Salt Lake Temple and Temple Square, bumping the annual visitor presence from the former 5 million all the way up to 10 million. A hang-up inside the goal of luring that many guests is a significant one: Most of them are barred, without a <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/10/07/what-new-lds-temple/\">clergy-approved recommend</a>, from entering the temple itself.</p><p>Here’s a better option: Let them in the square, as they are now, and, yes, let them in the temple, too. This is radical, I know, but stay with me.</p><p>Other religions allow visitors into their holy places, into cathedrals and basilicas smiled on by the Almighty, bedecked as they are by works of art by masters such as Michelangelo and Raphael and Bernini. How about if the Latter-day Saint leadership created a space inside the Salt Lake Temple where visitors from around the world could have a temple experience inside the actual temple?</p><p>Take some of the mystery out of it. Like the old Baptist revival preacher barked, “Get the people in the tent.”</p><p>It reads on the exterior of Latter-day Saint temples “House of the Lord.” Maybe visitors of all faiths or no faith at all could get just a taste of the building’s spirit by being allowed into a limited corner of the signature holy house’s newly renovated square footage. The Manhattan Temple, for instance, has floors inside its building that allow admission to folks who have no recommend.</p><p>That’s a start. It would be an important one, one that would elevate that guest experience.</p><p>Another possibility: As mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/12/31/lds-temple-square-tomorrow-could/\">The Tribune’s report</a>, the nearby Relief Society Building could be outfitted as a fully functioning (though not yet dedicated) temple to be kept permanently open for guests. It could be dedicated at “special times” so only recommend-carrying members could attend to relieve pressure on the Salt Lake Temple. At other times, it could welcome non-Latter-day Saint tourists. A common complaint among Temple Square visitors is that they are forbidden from stepping inside the principal building they came to see. Let them in, or offer this other option, giving them a chance to have a temple experience on the grounds.</p><p>How much is too much?</p><img alt=\"(Christopher Cherrington  |  The Salt Lake Tribune)\" height=\"1266\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/8WCp7xc_d3532UcF8hYW8rEMeM8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/TYSXUY2PR5BLZKLKWA7YNHSTGE.jpg\" width=\"2268\" /><br /><caption>(Christopher Cherrington  |  The Salt Lake Tribune)</caption><p>One of the problems for the church in creating an expanded Temple Square — whether new buildings are added, new lawns are manicured, new monuments are created, new lakes are dug and filled, new fountains are featured, new residences for top church leaders are constructed — is finding the right line between what is useful for the Lord’s work and what is seen as ridiculous excess. Between what is godlike and what is gaudy.</p><p>It’s one thing to visit and experience over-the-top structures that were built on the backs of the peasant poor to honor the heavens hundreds and hundreds years ago, and there are some magnificent minsters to see across Europe. It’s another to witness modern chapels, sanctuaries and even office buildings that are dripping with extravagant baubles via money and means taken from worshippers who donate their hard-earned cash for the love of the King of Kings.</p><p>Throwing in bits of tasteful design, interesting oddities, might be fine. Throwing around obscene displays of wealth could be seen as wasteful and worldly.</p><p>Also, if there are homeless travelers desperately camped out on the streets nearby, what message can that send other than … well, maybe some of the wealth that went into so much ostentatious beauty at Temple Square might have been better used helping those who are less fortunate.</p><p>It’s tricky business, this idea of elevating the guest experience. What would Jesus do?</p><p>Moreover, if the church plants grand greenery and forms bubbling fountains, where will it get the water? Of course, it can rely on water-wise plants and recycled water (as it does with many landmarks), but what happens <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/02/06/lds-church-is-silent-great-salt/\">if the Great Salt Lake dries up</a>, sending toxic particles into the air? How many millions will want to visit the Lord’s mountain wearing gas masks?</p><p>If it were up to me, and I was in charge, and water wasn’t an issue, I’d build two world-class 18-hole championship golf courses over those eight blocks, and let everyone who wants to visit Temple Square and learn a little something about the faith play for free, waiving all greens fees. See how many global visitors would stop by then. Is there anything in this terrestrial world more sacred than, say, Augusta National or Pinehurst No. 2? No, there is not.</p><p>Failing that, I’d keep what was necessary for the church to function in place, spruce things up here and there, but turn much of that downtown land into something similar to Manhattan’s Central Park, all of it beautifying and underscoring the appearance and importance of the faith’s centerpiece — its most notable temple. But that’s just me.</p><p>A gathering place for all</p><p>There are hurdles galore for the church as it considers what to do downtown. Will it be empowered to close public thoroughfares and build over them? How much input will it allow those who care about the health and heartbeat of Salt Lake City, not just about the image the church presents to those who come to visit? Will the potential dollars the church draws to Utah’s capital help boost restaurants and hotels and retailers and businesses enough to grant what the faith desires? What sort of consideration should those who are not followers of the faith be given, those who don’t see it in their best interests to have images of a single faith so dominant in the city center? What is that metro center going to look like in 10 or 15 or 50 years? What should it look like?</p><p>Let’s say it all plain, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints certainly has contributed in a huge way to Salt Lake City and its surrounding communities, having founded much of it and many of them. It has played and will continue to play a major role here in the shape, economy, culture and politics of the city. But it also should keep in mind the interests of those outside the faith.</p><p>Not everyone here desires a downtown dominated by the Latter-day Saint presence. Many would prefer an emphasis on diversity, putting out a welcome mat to all, seeking to smooth over a societal divide that does exist.</p><p>Most of the eight blocks in and around Temple Square belong to the church, true, but they also belong to all the multifaceted people of Salt Lake City. It’s their town, too.</p><img alt=\"(Francisco Kjolseth  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Tribune columnist Gordon Monson.\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/0S2IzNSxpIaVqZ0kcDABTTA0K6s=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/L5CCDJUOWJBVTFT76QPOUJER4I.jpg\" width=\"2900\" /><br /><caption>(Francisco Kjolseth  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Tribune columnist Gordon Monson.

In November The Washington Post observed that “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under criticism for not offering a clear plan for what happens in Gaza if Israel succeeds in its goal of deposing Hamas.” A headline in Foreign Affairs in December lamented “Israel’s Muddled Strategy in Gaza.”</p><p>But there are signs that some members of the Israeli government do indeed have a strategy, or at least a preference, for what happens next. It’s implicit in the kind of war Israel has waged, which has made Gaza largely unlivable. And a growing number of Israeli officials are saying it out loud: They don’t want to force just Hamas out of Gaza. They want many of Gaza’s people to leave, too.</p><p>The calls for population transfers started long before Gaza was reduced to the ruins that it is today. Six days after Hamas’s massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, the Intelligence Ministry proposed permanently relocating Gazans to the Sinai region of Egypt. On Nov. 14, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he supported “the voluntary emigration of Gaza Arabs to countries around the world.” Five days later, Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel endorsed “the voluntary resettlement of Palestinians in Gaza, for humanitarian reasons, outside of the Strip.”</p><p>The Israel Hayom newspaper reported on Nov. 30 that Mr. Netanyahu had asked Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, one of his closest confidants, to develop a plan to “thin” the population in Gaza “to a minimum” by prying open Egypt’s doors and opening up sea routes to other countries. Mr. Netanyahu also reportedly urged President Biden and the leaders of Britain and France to push Egypt to admit hundreds of thousands of Gazan refugees.</p><p>At times, Israeli officials have downplayed or denied these reports. Mr. Netanyahu’s office called the Intelligence Ministry’s transfer plan a mere “concept paper” and Israel’s embassy in Washington clarified that the intelligence minister was speaking only for herself. Other influential government ministers — like Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, a Netanyahu rival and former chief of staff of the Israeli military who joined the government after Oct. 7 — oppose moving Gaza’s population outside the Strip, according to Israel Hayom. Mr. Gallant, it emerged last week, has floated a proposal that would have Palestinians unconnected to Hamas or the Palestinian Authority administering the territory, with other countries overseeing reconstruction.</p><p>But in recent days the talk of Palestinian departures from Gaza has grown louder. At a meeting of his Likud party on Dec. 25, Mr. Netanyahu was urged by a legislator to put into place a team to facilitate the “voluntary” departure of Palestinians from Gaza. The prime minister reportedly replied that the government was “working on” finding countries willing to take them.</p><p>Similar comments from Israel’s national security minister followed, with The Times of Israel asserting on Wednesday that voluntary resettlement from Gaza is gradually becoming “a key official policy of the government.”</p><p>Some might dismiss this talk of population transfer as wartime bluster. But on the ground, it is already well underway: Gaza is becoming uninhabitable. According to the United Nations, an estimated 85 percent of Gaza’s people are now displaced. Even if they could return to their homes, many would have little to go back to since, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, nearly 70 percent of Gaza’s housing is damaged or destroyed.</p><p>More than 22,000 Gazans have been killed in the conflict so far, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and many more are in acute danger. According to the Gaza director of affairs for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, 40 percent of the Strip’s residents are at risk of famine. Given the collapse of Gaza’s sanitation and medical systems, as much as a quarter of Gaza’s people could die within the year, mostly from disease or lack of access to medical care, according to a recent estimate by Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.</p><p>If the fighting in Gaza ends soon, this cataclysm could ease. But in late December, Mr. Netanyahu suggested that Israel’s war in Gaza would “last for many more months,” albeit with fewer troops. Defense Minister Gallant has said it could take years. And as long as hostilities in Gaza continue, Israel will not allow most of Gaza’s displaced to go back to their homes for safety’s sake, the Israeli journalist Nadav Eyal recently reported. They may not return for “at least a year,” he suggested.</p><p>The humanitarian catastrophe, in other words, is likely to persist. And the longer it does, the more pressure Egypt will feel to alleviate it by letting Gaza’s residents in. Israeli officials would most likely continue to depict such a migration as voluntary, despite having created the conditions that precipitated it.</p><p>So far, both Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and the Biden administration have said they adamantly oppose relocating Gaza’s people. The U.S. State Department last week said the Israeli government has repeatedly told American officials that resettlement outside Gaza is not its official policy.</p><p>But some members of Israel’s government reportedly believe that Egypt — which owes creditors a whopping $28 billion in debt payments next year — is vulnerable to pressure. And U.S. politics could always change: Asked last month what should happen to Gaza’s Palestinians, the Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley replied, “They should go to pro-Hamas countries.”</p><p>There’s a chilling historical backdrop to all this. Palestinians in Gaza know that if they leave, Israel is unlikely to let them to return. They know this because most of them are descendants of the expulsion and flight that occurred around Israel’s founding in 1948, which Palestinians call the nakba. They live in Gaza because Israel didn’t let their families return to the places that then became part of Israel. Hundreds of thousands more Palestinians were displaced when Israel conquered the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. It didn’t let many of those refugees return either.</p><p>Israel’s leaders rarely express regret for these mass displacements. Sometimes, they even invoke them as precedent. Addressing Palestinians on Facebook after three Israelis were murdered in the West Bank in 2017, Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s current national security adviser, warned, “This is how a ‘nakba’ begins. Just like this. Remember ‘48. Remember ‘67.”</p><p>He ended his post with the words, “You’ve been warned!”</p><p>The world has been warned too.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/07/opinion/israel-gaza-war.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: What’s going on with the Utah Democratic Party?

And that is our hell.</p><p>“You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said in his speech, making a forceful case that America, which dumped the mad King George, should not embrace the mad King Donald.</p><p>If we bow down to a wannabe dictator who loves dictators, who echoes the language of Nazi Germany, who egged on the mob on Jan. 6 and then rewrote the facts to “steal history” just as he tried to steal the election — what does that say about who we are, Biden wondered?</p><p>Rejecting Trump’s campaign of grievance, vengeance, malignance and connivance, the president said, “We never bow. We never bend. We speak of possibilities — not carnage. We’re not weighed down by grievances. We don’t foster fear. We don’t walk around as victims.”</p><p>On Thursday, the Biden-Harris campaign blasted out excerpts from a Margaret Sullivan column in The Guardian, upbraiding the media on its tendency to fall into “performative neutrality,” focusing too much on Biden’s presentation and poll numbers and not enough on stressing what a second Trump presidency would mean.</p><p>Journalists should not fear looking as if they’re “in the tank” for Biden if they zero in on Trump’s seditious behavior, Sullivan said; the media should worry less about the horse race than about underscoring that many of Trump’s threats are authoritarian.</p><p>She is right that the media must constantly remind itself not to use old tropes on a new trollop like Trump, particularly since the media is in a confluence of interest with Trump — as he himself has pointed out.</p><p>Thanks to Trump, journalists can be festooned with gold — lucrative book contracts, TV deals and speaking gigs. The man who enriched himself with millions from foreign states and royalty seeking favors from the United States has the power to enrich us, too. He’s a once-in-a-lifetime story, the outlandish star of an even bigger reality show than his last.</p><p>He put up a video on Truth Social on Friday touting the idea that God created him as a caretaker and “shepherd to mankind.” (It also chided Melania, showing her tripping and acting as if all she had to do was lunch with friends.) A narrator intones: “God said, ‘I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, fix this country, work all day, fight the Marxists, eat supper, then go to the Oval Office and stay past midnight at a meeting of the heads of state,’” topping off a hard week with Sunday church. “So God made Trump.” It was bound to happen: Trump playing divine victim, to pass himself off as Christlike or even hardworking. Both are equally untrue.</p><p>At his Friday afternoon speech in Sioux Center, Iowa, Trump resorted to his bully-boy ways, mocking Biden’s stutter.</p><p>I am not sure whether pounding away on the facts will work in a country with alternate realities. According to a new Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, 25% of Americans said it is “probably” or “definitely” true that the FBI was behind Jan. 6. Among Republicans, the Post said, 34% said the FBI “organized and encouraged the insurrection, compared with 30% of independents and 13% of Democrats.”</p><p>If people don’t know by now that Trump tried to overthrow the government he was running on Jan. 6; if they don’t know that the MAGA fanatics breaking into the Capitol, beating up cops and threatening to harm Pelosi and hang Mike Pence were criminals, not “patriots” and “hostages,” as Trump risibly calls them; if they don’t know that Trump created the radical Supreme Court that is stripping women of their rights, then they don’t want to know, or they just don’t care.</p><p>But the media must pound on. The duplicitous enablers at Fox News aside, journalists learned a lot in 2016 and have changed practices to better fence with Trump, fact-checking him more closely, engaging in defensive reporting, no longer covering every tweet like holy writ. Threats to democracy now count as a beat, just like schools and courts; the Times uses the rubric “Democracy Challenged.”</p><p>When Dick Cheney was a deranged vice president, I was not permitted to call him a liar in my column. But now the Times lets columnists call Trump a liar. We have learned to separate the man from the office. Just because someone sits in the hallowed White House doesn’t mean he deserves the respect of the office. Not if he’s ginning up a fake war or if he’s flirting with treason and white supremacy.</p><p>Still, the Biden-Harris campaign’s trumpeting of Sullivan’s column gives the impression that it expects the media to prop up Biden.</p><p>Biden has to press his own case and not rely on the media or Trump’s fatuousness to win the election for him.</p><p>People don’t want to vote against somebody; they want to vote <i>for</i> somebody.</p><p>The president must continue to be aggressive in convincing people he’s the best alternative; that, at 81, he’s not too old for the job; that he has solutions to stop the chaos on the border and relentless death in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>You do your job, Mr. President, and we’ll do ours.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/opinion/trump-biden-election.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'How ‘Witness’ became a thrilling audio drama and a parable about America’s soul',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'How ‘Witness’ became a thrilling audio drama and a parable about America’s soul'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/how-witness-became-thrilling-audio/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/how-witness-became-thrilling-audio/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/01/09/how-witness-became-thrilling-audio/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Bob Smietana | Religion News Service'}],\n   'author': 'Bob Smietana | Religion News Service',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Bob Smietana | Religion News Service'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'A look at the new podcast based on the 1985 film \"Witness,\" set in an Amish community.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'A look at the new podcast based on the 1985 film \"Witness,\" set in an Amish community.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>The 1985 film “Witness” was a surprise hit — part cop thriller, part Amish romance, with a pair of stars in Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis at the top of their game, a crackerjack script and a brilliant director in Peter Weir.</p><p>Despite a modest budget of $12 million and few expectations, the film earned more than $65 million at the box office and a host of Academy Award nominations (it won for best original screenplay and editing) and became a beloved classic, giving moviegoers worldwide a view into the life of the Amish. It was also a parable about America’s soul and what happens to true believers when the institutions and leaders they trusted fail them. Do they give up — or do they keep the faith?</p><p>Those questions are at the heart of a new adaptation of “Witness” as an audio drama for Audible Studios, which debuted just before the new year. The adaptation from award-winning podcast maker<a href=\"https://www.gideon-media.com/\"> Gideon Media</a> is a modern miracle of sorts — both true to the original film and something that feels brand-new.</p><p>The new adaptation got its start during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when Hollywood studios had shut down production. An official at Paramount Studios, which owns the rights to “Witness,” reached out to Sean Williams, a Gideon producer and writer, to see if they could work together.</p><p>“When the pandemic hit, basically every network in America shut down,” Williams said in a recent interview. “But then everyone found out that we could still make shows.”</p><p>Paramount gave Gideon a list of possible films to adapt, including “Roman Holiday” and “Witness.” Williams and his colleagues sent a list back. Among their top choices were the 1976 films “Marathon Man” and another film from 1985, “Clue.”</p><p>When Paramount asked them to adapt “Witness,” the Gideon brain trust had a bit of panic. The 1985 film is a visual masterpiece, known for its minimal dialogue — Weir<a href=\"https://cinephiliabeyond.org/peter-weirs-witness-deep-subtle-complex-social-comment-disguised-police-thriller/\"> famously</a> cut as many lines out of the script as possible.</p><p>“It’s essentially a silent film,” said Mac Rogers, who wrote the script for the adaptation.</p><p>The audio drama, like the film, follows the story of Rachel Lapp, an Amish woman who is traveling with her young son, Samuel, by train to see her sister, who lives in a different Amish settlement. During a stopover in Philadelphia, Samuel witnesses the murder of an undercover cop. When Samuel is questioned by John Book, a police detective, the boy identifies another police officer as the killer. That crooked officer attempts to kill Book, sending Book and the Lapps running for their lives. Book, who suffers a gunshot wound, takes refuge among the Amish.</p><p>The Amish reality</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in making the audio drama was getting the Amish right, said Jordana Williams, who directed the project. That meant getting help.</p><p>“We just didn’t know a lot,” said Williams, who is married to Sean Williams.</p><p>They eventually connected with<a href=\"https://marybyler.podbean.com/\"> Mary Byler</a>, a writer and podcaster who grew up in Old Order Amish communities. Byler was skeptical of the project at first. Byler, who uses they/them pronouns, had long disliked the “Witness” film, which they said portrayed an idyllic view of the Amish instead of showing them as complex human beings who are both saints and sinners. Much of the film revolves around the fear that the violence and danger of the outside world, especially urban life, would threaten the Amish.</p><p>The reality is much more complicated, said Byler. There is goodness and danger among the Amish — something they know firsthand. Byler left their Amish family in the early 2000s after<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=189191&amp;page=1\"> reporting</a> their brothers to the police for sexual abuse. Their brothers were later convicted.</p><p>Byler signed on for the project in hopes that it would depict the Amish in both their flaws and virtues. Byler, who runs a website called <a href=\"https://www.themisfitamish.com/\">The Misfit Amish</a>, said they didn’t want the Amish to be demonized — but did want them to be portrayed as real people and not stereotypes.</p><p>The new adaptation makes mentions of abuse — one reason Rachel Lapp leaves at the beginning of the story, in this version, is that there is an abuser in the settlement where she lives. The man has confessed and been forgiven by the community — but has never faced consequences for his actions. Rachel fears he still may be a danger — and is angry with the community’s leaders for putting children in danger.</p><p>Rogers and his colleagues believed their story should make mention of the abuse crisis, which has gained public attention in recent years. It wasn’t a central part of the story, but it was a detail they could not overlook.</p><p>Paramount agreed, allowing Gideon to update the story — as long as the adaptation still stuck with the basic storyline of the film, which is a fast-paced thriller at its heart.</p><p>“They were really good partners on this,” said Jordana Williams.</p><p>That storyline change puts Rachel and Book in similar circumstances. Both were true believers— he in police work, she in the faith of the Amish. Both feel betrayed and let down by people they trusted and are trying to figure out what to do next.</p><p>“This is not just an Amish story,” said Byler. “This is a faith story. And there is a faith crisis. People from all walks and ways of life have been becoming disillusioned with their religious leaders, their religious institutions.”</p><p>Women in Amish communities</p><p>While the film depicts Rachel Lapp as a somewhat passive character, she has more agency in the podcast version, something that is closer to real life. Karen Johnson-Weiner, a retired professor of anthropology at SUNY Potsdam who has long studied the Amish, said Amish women have more influence in their communities than people realize. While they can’t hold ministerial office, they are church members and care about the witness of their community.</p><p>“Within their communities, Amish women have agency,” she said. “They have authority.”</p><p>David Weaver-Zercher, a professor of American religious history at Messiah University and co-author of “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amish-Grace-Forgiveness-Transcended-Tragedy/dp/0470344040\">Amish Grace</a>,” a book about the 2006 shooting at an Amish schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pa., said the Amish have two major practices that are often seen as being in tension. They forgive those who do harm — as seen in the way the Amish forgave the Nickel Mines shooter. And yet they also shun those who break the rules of their community.</p><p>“How do you understand Amish shunning and their forgiveness?” he asked.</p><p>That tension plays out during a key moment of the “Witness” adaptation. After Rachel’s father-in-law, Eli, discovers her dancing with Book in a barn, Eli warns Rachel that her relationship with the police officer could lead to her being shunned.</p><p>In response, Rachel is indignant that Book’s presence in the community is seen as something sinful — while an abuser in the community has been forgiven and walks freely. Book, she says, feels guilt for putting her son in danger, while church leaders have no shame for putting the children in their community at risk.</p><p>“John Book carries himself every day like a penitent,” she says in the adaptation. “You see it a mile away. He buckles under the shame of endangering Samuel in his every step. Yet this man who hurts the gentlest among us walks around and jokes and invites us to supper. And he is not the only one.”</p><p>Learning more about the details of Amish life helped Rogers solve one of his biggest problems in adapting the film to audio drama. Perhaps the most memorable<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPLb_POsC7M&amp;t=1s\"> scene</a> in “Witness” is the barn raising — more than six minutes long with hardly any dialogue.</p><p>“I remember watching the movie and thinking, what am I supposed to do?” he said. “This is just going to be hammering for 20 minutes on audio and nothing else.”</p><p>After learning that some Amish use<a href=\"https://baileylineroad.com/amish-carpenters-cordless-to\"> battery-operated tools</a>, such as cordless drills and circular saws, Roger decided to add those sounds to the barn-raising scene, which helped bring the scene to life. Learning about the loopholes also gave him some insights into how the Amish live out their values in unexpected ways.</p><p>“My sense is that people develop this sense of themselves based on certain ironclad principles about how they should live, but then they find lots of ways to kind of work around them,” he said. “Those little imperfections enrich the characters tremendously.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'How Utah’s snowpack looks after the weekend storms',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'How Utah’s snowpack looks after the weekend storms'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/09/heres-what-weekends-storms-did/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/09/heres-what-weekends-storms-did/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/09/heres-what-weekends-storms-did/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Leia Larsen'}],\n   'author': 'Leia Larsen',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Leia Larsen'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 15:19:23 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=15, tm_min=19, tm_sec=23, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'Despite days of snowstorms, state is still below normal for this time of year.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Despite days of snowstorms, state is still below normal for this time of year.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Utahns celebrated a series of storms that dumped snow statewide over the weekend.</p><p>The state still has a ways to go to reach a normal snowpack for this time of year, however, and is nowhere on track to have the record-breaking winter seen last year.

Criteria or a rubric to help committee members select schools was not provided or referenced in the email.</p><p>That directive has left parents like Rosemary Winters skeptical about how the July list of seven schools came to be — and whether bias was a factor.</p><p>To Winters, it appeared that the committee members “started with a subjective list ... and then afterward, they tried to reverse-engineer it and tell us what criteria they used.”</p><p>Another parent, Troy Davis, questioned whether the<b> </b>district’s closure process amounted to a policy violation. According to the district’s G-5 administrative policy, officials were required to create a formal<b> </b>school boundary study list by the end of February.</p><p>Davis argued the “approval of recommendations in a [PowerPoint presentation] does not constitute the creation and approval of an Official Study List,” citing the February vote to evaluate all elementary schools. He also noted a handful of meetings with school principals and School Community Council chairs that happened in June, outside of the district’s self-imposed timeline of March to May for such meetings.</p><p>That’s why Davis on Friday sent board members Conley’s June email, which was obtained before The Tribune through a separate records request. In the message, he highlighted the email section where Conley instructed committee members to come to a summer meeting<b> </b>with seven schools in mind.</p><p>“The large majority of us understand the need to close schools and we can support a process that is backed by data and free of bias,” Davis wrote. “The process ... has not lived up to those expectations.”</p><p>District responds</p><p>In a response to Davis’s email, which the district shared with The Tribune, Superintendent Elizabeth Grant stated the board during its Feb. 7 meeting<b> </b>approved recommendations to evaluate all 27 elementary schools for closure.<b> </b>Certain<b> </b>meetings with principals and School Community Council members were also extended because of various unforeseen circumstances, she wrote, such as Conley being out on protected leave for a time period.</p><p>“I appreciate your advocacy for our elementary schools and the need for the district to follow its board policies and administrative procedures,” Grant responded. “As the district works through this process for the first time in many years, we appreciate correspondence like this as it will help us hone our processes moving forward.”</p><p>The response did not specifically mention the June email from Conley. The district did not immediately respond to a request from The Tribune for further comment regarding Conley’s email to committee members.</p><p>The last time the district physically closed campuses was in 2002, when Lowell and Rosslyn Heights elementaries were shuttered.</p><p>The decision to potentially close campuses again has mostly aimed to “right-size” schools, district officials have said. “Right-sizing” means having around three teachers per grade level at a given school, with around 25 students per classroom, according to the district.</p><p>In December 2022, state auditors <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2022/12/13/millions-wasted-salt-lake-city/\" target=\"_blank\">criticized the district</a> for spending money to keep schools open that were losing students, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.</p><p>Heading into Tuesday’s potential closure vote, both Davis and Winters want board members to vote no, start over, and conduct what they believe should be a fairer closure process.</p><p>“This is what would improve education for out students,” Winters said. “But today, I don’t have that confidence, and I feel like my school could be closed and I won’t have a good reason to share with my third-grader on why his school is closing.”</p><p>For those who can’t attend the Tuesday board meeting in person, the meeting will be streamed online <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@slcschools/streams\" target=\"_blank\">via the district’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Utah Jazz are feeling some swag after two big wins on the road',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Utah Jazz are feeling some swag after two big wins on the road'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/utah-jazz-are-feeling-some-swag/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/utah-jazz-are-feeling-some-swag/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/utah-jazz-are-feeling-some-swag/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Eric Walden'}],\n   'author': 'Eric Walden',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Eric Walden'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 05:47:18 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=5, tm_min=47, tm_sec=18, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'The Utah Jazz followed Saturday’s victory over the Sixers with another on Monday vs. the Bucks, and are hoping the confidence they’re feeling in the aftermath can produce more good results.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'The Utah Jazz followed Saturday’s victory over the Sixers with another on Monday vs. the Bucks, and are hoping the confidence they’re feeling in the aftermath can produce more good results.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><b>Milwaukee</b> • When Utah Jazz head coach Will Hardy was asked pregame last Friday about the upcoming sequence of matchups featuring the Celtics, 76ers, Bucks, and Nuggets, he quipped, “I appreciate the nightmare fuel.”</p><p>Reminded of that comment following Monday night’s 132-116 victory over Milwaukee, he pleaded ignorance.</p><p>“Did I say that?” Hardy interjected.</p><p>He did. But he can be forgiven for either genuinely not remembering or simply feigning ignorance. The Denver game is still to come this Wednesday at the Delta Center; but winning two of the three prior matchups — on the road, no less — has the team feeling a little more confident in the aftermath.</p><p>“I like to call it ‘swag,’ and our swag is a little up right now,” said Kris Dunn, who contributed 13 assists and anchored a defensive effort by playing what Hardy referred to as a free safety role defensively. “We just keep doing the right things. We have a lot of talent on this team. If we move the ball, if we guard at a high level, good things can happen, as we showed in this three-game road trip.”</p><p>The vibes were definitely different at the end of the trip than at the beginning.</p><p>A blowout loss in Boston, in which the Jazz made only 7 of their first 40 shots, was dispiriting.</p><p>But pulling off a victory the very next night in Philadelphia and then following that up with a wire-to-wire win against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks had the locker room in a decidedly vibrant mood, even a huge winter snowstorm threatened their getaway.</p><p>It should be noted for posterity’s sake that the Sixers were playing without reigning Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid, while Milwaukee was sans the services of All-Star guard Damian Lillard.</p><p>Utah’s coaches and players are aware. And they are undeterred in their optimism.</p><p>“Those wins right there just show that we can pretty much play with the best of ‘em,” said Collin Sexton, whose 19 points Monday night at Fiserv Forum included back-to-back-to-back 3-pointers in a blistering first quarter. “We can play against anybody, no matter our record, no matter their record. We just gotta go lace our shoes up.”</p><p>They apparently were laced to perfection on this occasion.</p><p>After Utah shot just 8 for 30 from beyond the arc in Philadelphia, Hardy spoke pregame in Milwaukee about the need to get the Jazz’s spacing — particularly in the corners — re-optimized. The team made seven triples in the first seven minutes against the Bucks, and went 11 for 17 beyond the arc in the opening period overall en route to a shocking 41-23 lead.</p><p>“That first quarter was fun,” noted Lauri Markkanen, who would go on to finish with 21 points and 14 rebounds.</p><p>The good times continued in the second period, as Utah was 16 for 30 from deep by halftime in building up a 77-46 advantage.</p><p>The third saw the Bucks make an inevitable rally, as Utah’s habits got a bit sloppy and Milwaukee dialed up the energy, with the turnovers leading to transition and briefly cutting the advantage cut to single digits, before Utah settled for a 101-90 lead at the break.</p><p>The coach made it a point between quarters to project calm, and to give his players a reassuring message.</p><p>“We talked with this group about [how] we would have signed up [before the game] to be up 11 going into the fourth quarter,” said Hardy. “It was about trying to win the last 12 minutes and get out of here with a win.”</p><p>Check and check.</p><p>While Khris Middleton momentarily got the Bucks back within single digits, rookie Keyonte George followed with a 3 from beyond the arc, and then a floater-and-one that seemed to pump life back into the group — to say nothing of ballooning the lead back up to 15.</p><p>“The maturity throughout the whole game was the big thing,” Dunn noted, including the 20-year-old George within that.</p><p>The next few minutes would see Milwaukee surge, then the Jazz weather the attack, throw a counter-pinch, and re-expand the advantage.</p><p>And just like that, a team that seemingly couldn’t buy a win away from the Delta Center a month ago is now up to seven victories away from home this season.</p><p>“It’s good to come on the road and really get together as a team. There’s no fans behind us — it’s just what we have in the locker room,” said Markkanen. “It’s easier to come together on the road. We didn’t get many wins early in the year, but I think it’s starting to show off.”</p><p>Hardy, meanwhile, eventually conceded remembering the “nightmare fuel” comment.</p><p>Naturally, though, he felt a bit differently about the situation after seeing that stretch yield consecutive wins in the buildings of top-three teams in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>“I think it’s a great way for us to build confidence. It’s a great way for us to understand that when we play as a team, nobody has to do it on their own, and that we’re capable of beating good teams on the road,” said Hardy. “Early in the year, there were two question marks: 1. Can we be a good team? And 2. Can we win on the road? And to beat two good teams on the road — the success we’ve had on the road lately, not just these two, but the last three weeks, it’s big for the confidence of the team.”</p><p>Of course, the final game of that aforementioned killer quartet is yet to be played.</p><p>The Nuggets are up next.</p><p>And while the swag is up a little right now, the quest to answer that first question mark still hangs in the balance.</p><p>“It’s a long season — we don’t want to get too high or too low,” said Dunn. “We understand Denver’s a championship team and they’re coming into our house. And we’ve got protect our home court.”</p><p>Two wins in this stretch are two more than some thought the team would get at all.</p><p>But if they can manage three? Well, then there just might not be any more nightmares to come the rest of this season.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'World-beater: Michigan defeats Washington for college football national championship',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'World-beater: Michigan defeats Washington for college football national championship'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/08/world-beaters-michigan-defeats/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/08/world-beaters-michigan-defeats/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2024/01/08/world-beaters-michigan-defeats/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Athletic'}],\n   'author': 'The Athletic',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Athletic'},\n   'published': 'Tue, 09 Jan 2024 06:21:07 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=6, tm_min=21, tm_sec=7, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=9, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'Michigan defeats Washington 34-13 to claim its first national football championship since 1997.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Michigan defeats Washington 34-13 to claim its first national football championship since 1997.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>It’s been 26 years, but finally, no one has it better than Michigan.</p><p>The Wolverines, who ranked second in passing yards allowed per game with 150.0 heading into title town, faced their toughest task yet in taming the flamethrower that is Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Michigan answered the bell, subduing Penix to 255 yards and one touchdown — the only Washington TD on the night — against two interceptions on 27-of-51 passing, a vast divergence from the usual performance of the nation’s leader in passing yards per game (332.0) and passing yards (4,648) before kickoff.</p><p>Couple that with the Wolverines’ speed and they downed the Huskies 34-13 to emerge as the 2023 College Football Playoff national champion. It is Michigan’s first title since 1997 and under coach Jim Harbaugh.</p><p>Down 27-13 with less than five minutes to play, Penix tried to throw a pass to wide receiver Jalen McMillan, but was picked off in double coverage. Michigan defensive back Mike Sainristil ran it back 80 yards before running back Blake Corum punched it in for the solidifier.</p><p>Corum finished with 134 rushing yards and two touchdowns while his counterpart Donovan Edwards added 104 yards and another two scores on the ground.</p><p>Coming out of the half down 17-10, Penix was swallowed by the Wolverines’ defensive line on the first play, throwing an interception to Michigan defensive back Will Johnson and giving up the ball on Washington’s 32. Penix was seen hobbling around the sideline after a teammate stepped on his ankle. The Huskies defense came up big, with the help of two Michigan penalties, to only surrender a field goal and keep the game at bay, 20-10. It wasn’t enough, and Michigan reclaimed the swaying momentum to hold a wire-to-wire lead.</p><img alt=\"Michigan running back Donovan Edwards celebrates after scoring against Washington during the first half of the national championship NCAA College Football Playoff game Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Houston.

(AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vasquez) (Godofredo A. Vasquez/)</caption><p>Michigan set the tone as early as possible, gaining five first downs on an eight-play drive with its first touches on ball to jump out to a 7-0 lead. By the time Michigan held a 14-3 lead with 2:23 to go in the first quarter, it had 115 rushing yards. By the end of the first, Edwards had 87 yards and two touchdowns after only having three TDs on the season entering the game. It was an off-brand job by Washington, which allowed only two rush plays of 40-plus yards all season before Monday night. Washington let up three such rushes in the first half, with Edwards and Corum combined.</p><p>In the air, a rather forgotten part of Michigan’s first half, quarterback J.J. McCarthy completed his first three passes of the game but then just two of the next nine. He was 0-for-4 on third and fourth downs at half. He finished 10-of-18 for 140 yards.</p><p>On the day, Washington posted 301 total yards to Michigan’s 444. Nearly 85 percent of Washington’s yards came in the air, while Michigan, inversely, racked up nearly 68 percent of its yardage on the ground.</p><p>Michigan finally broke through and brought home a national championship in a year that at times felt more like a wild season of reality TV. This team had the right stuff to finish the job after consecutive CFP semifinal losses in 2022 and 2023, won its third consecutive Big Ten title thanks to gritty wins over Penn State and Ohio State, kept fighting for an overtime triumph against Alabama in the Rose Bowl and, in its biggest test yet, shut down Washington and its prolific offense. This was a special team on a path to destiny.</p><p>And that path was littered with drama, from Harbaugh serving a three-game suspension to start the season to the in-season investigation into Connor Stalions’ impermissible signal stealing operation to another three-game Harbaugh suspension served up as his team landed in State College, Pa. Through it all, no matter who was coaching or who they were playing, these Wolverines were undeterred. They had the No. 1 defense in college football, experienced leaders who refused to lose and the poise to play their best in their biggest games.</p><p>Edwards has a reputation for showing up in big moments. He wasn’t much of a factor for much of this season, averaging just 3 1/2 yards per carry in a limited role. But in the national championship game, big-game Donovan Edwards reappeared in stunning fashion.</p><p>Edwards opened the game with a 41-yard touchdown burst and scored again on Michigan’s next drive with a 46-yard run. Edwards laid the groundwork for Michigan’s victory and Corum finished it, plunging into the end zone from 12 yards out to give the Wolverines a two-touchdown lead.</p><p>The two-headed rushing attack Michigan envisioned with Corum and Edwards didn’t materialize for much of the season, but it showed up in the biggest game of the year. Both players topped 100 yards on the ground, with Edwards rushing for 104 and Corum rushing for 134. When the Wolverines run the ball that way, nobody can stop them.</p><p>Statistically, it was not the worst performance of Penix’s brilliant season. But considering the stakes, it felt like it.</p><p>One week after putting on a dazzling performance in a College Football Playoff win over Texas, Penix was beaten and beaten down, with he and his Washington teammates falling to Michigan in the national title game in NRG Stadium in Houston. The pinpoint accuracy and explosive plays that wowed observers against the Longhorns were nowhere to be found Monday night.</p><p>He appeared in physical pain by the end, though the loss of a perfect season likely hurt more. There were opportunities for big plays, but Penix was uncharacteristically off on several opportunities. And when he was on target he was hurt by dropped passes.</p><p>It looked early like Michigan was going to run away with the game — literally, after two Edwards touchdown runs of more than 40 yards. But credit Washington’s defense for its resilience and toughness for allowing the Huskies to hang around in this game, even with Penix not nearly as crisp as he was a week ago in the Sugar Bowl. After all the fireworks in the game’s first 17 minutes, Michigan went punt, turnover on downs, punt, field goal, punt, punt, punt; the longest drive the Wolverines put together only went 41 yards … until that touchdown drive at the midpoint of the fourth quarter that resulted in a Corum touchdown and put Michigan up by two scores.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'What former BYU forward Caleb Lohner said about playing his old team',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'What former BYU forward Caleb Lohner said about playing his old team'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/08/what-former-byu-forward-caleb/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/08/what-former-byu-forward-caleb/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/08/what-former-byu-forward-caleb/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Alex Vejar'}],\n   'author': 'Alex Vejar',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Alex Vejar'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 22:09:47 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=22, tm_min=9, tm_sec=47, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Tuesday's game between BYU and Baylor will be a Top 25 matchup.

Here is what he said.</p><p>On facing BYU</p><p>“You transfer from a school, you want to beat them. But they have a great program, a great team. Either way, selfishly, for me, it would be a great win. But also for the team, they’re a great basketball program. So any game in the Big 12 we can win is a good game.”</p><p>On his friends at BYU</p><p>“I still keep up with quite a few of the guys. A lot of the guys that I played with in the past and at BYU are great guys. My situation, [I] think I just needed to be at Baylor and that was it. But yeah, still great relationships over there.</p><p>On what he thinks of BYU as a team</p><p>“They shoot the ball really well. They cut, super active, especially when their big gets it at the top of the key. They run all these different motions and pin-downs and ball screens. Fast-paced team on offense. I think it’ll be important for us to talk through a lot of those switches and defensive schemes that we’re going to have going into the game. But they’re great basketball team, great basketball program. It’s going to be a good one.”</p><p>On defending BYU’s passing</p><p>“They have a great big who is really, really smart with the ball. Traditionally, I think a lot of we’ve played in the past, they’ve had more traditional rollers. So with them just being the assist team that they are, keeping your head on a swivel, making sure you’re not getting back cut, watching out for guys on the help side. Again, they’re a great passing team, a great 3-point shooting team.

Él cree que cuando las oficinas universitarias apoyan a poblaciones estudiantiles específicas, como los estudiantes latinos o negros, crean división y exclusión para otros.</p><p>“Necesitamos centrar los esfuerzos en las universidades en los estudiantes y en los individuos, en lugar de en los grupos”, afirmó. “Debe ser centrado y justo para todos”.</p><p>Dijo que ha oído que más estudiantes de color son estudiantes universitarios de primera generación que estudiantes blancos, lo cual es cierto. Pero en lugar de centrarse en los estudiantes de color, dijo, y excluir a los estudiantes blancos que también podrían ser los primeros en sus familias en asistir a la escuela, preferiría ver una oficina para todos los estudiantes de primera generación, lo que considera que hace que el acceso sea más fácil. amplio y disponible para todos en lugar de para unos pocos.</p><p>De manera similar, preferiría ver esfuerzos para apoyar a los estudiantes de familias que viven por debajo del nivel de pobreza que oficinas basadas en raza o etnia. Lo describió como “basarlo en una característica demográfica más que en el color de la piel de alguien”.</p><p>Johnson dijo que no quiere que se gaste dinero estatal “para ayudar a un grupo sobre otro simplemente por su pertenencia a un grupo”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/27/republican-lawmaker-pulls-his-too/\">El año pasado, Johnson dijo que cada año se gastan aproximadamente $11 millones en programas DEI en colegios y universidades de Utah</a>, una cifra que, según dijo, proviene de investigaciones legislativas. Eso lo financian los contribuyentes y él siente que existe la obligación de gastarlo de una manera que produzca resultados notables.</p><p>Cuando se le preguntó qué resultados necesitaría mostrar una oficina de DEI para ser considerada exitosa, Johnson no dio ejemplos específicos, sino que señaló que el gobernador también cuestiona qué métricas están alcanzando los programas.</p><p>“Hay un papel claro de la educación y de hacer que las personas sean mejores ciudadanos y ciudadanos más productivos”, dijo Johnson. “Y si no obtenemos retorno de esa inversión, tenemos que preguntarnos, ¿por qué hacemos esto? ¿Qué obtendremos a cambio?</p><p>Dijo que parte de su impulso también proviene del reciente fallo de la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos de prohibir la acción afirmativa (destinada a abrir oportunidades para personas de minorías y entornos subrepresentados) con aceptaciones universitarias. Le gustaría que las universidades, en general, dejaran de centrarse en la raza.</p><p>Él siente que, con esos esfuerzos, la educación superior se ha alejado de su misión de educar a los estudiantes y ha comenzado a tener un sesgo contra los conservadores que asisten o trabajan allí. Dice que necesitan hacer más para adoptar la “diversidad de puntos de vista”.</p><p>“Este es un caso en el que el péndulo se ha alejado demasiado de donde estaba”, dijo.</p><p>Johnson comenzó como profesor en la Universidad de Mississippi. Se tomó un descanso, fundó una empresa de software y luego regresó como profesor en la Universidad Estatal de Utah. Mientras tanto, dijo: “Habiendo estado dentro de ese sistema y visto lo que está sucediendo, es más difícil para un conservador dentro del sistema que cuando yo comencé”.</p><p>Dijo que apoya la reciente iniciativa del Sistema de Educación Superior de Utah que exige que <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/02/gov-cox-doesnt-want-utah-colleges/\">el liderazgo de las universidades públicas del estado sea neutral en cuestiones políticas. </a>También impone limitaciones al discurso de los estudiantes, incluido el hecho de que un grupo no puede gritar a otro, incluso si no están de acuerdo sobre un tema o sienten que es un discurso de odio.</p><p>Esto se produjo después de que se retirara <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/11/17/university-utah-withdrew-its/\">el patrocinio de un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad de Utah, MECHA,</a> después de que la escuela dijera que interrumpió el evento de un club conservador que criticaba a la comunidad transgénero.</p><p>Johnson dijo que quiere que las universidades adopten y apoyen la “diversidad de puntos de vista” en el futuro.</p><p>Otro legislador analiza las “pruebas de fuego” universitarias</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/HALLK/\">La representante Katy Hall, republicana por South Ogden</a>, también presentó en la última sesión un proyecto de ley sobre DEI que busca revivir.</p><p>Su intento anterior buscaba prohibir que las escuelas, tanto las públicas como las escuelas K-12, preguntaran a un solicitante cualquier cosa sobre su trabajo para promover la inclusión y la diversidad. Pasó por la Cámara, pero quedó retenido en un comité del Senado.</p><p>La idea estaba en línea con lo que Cox había apuntado recientemente en sus declaraciones.</p><p>Hall no respondió a varias solicitudes para hablar con The Tribune para esta historia, pero un portavoz de la Casa de Utah envió un comunicado suyo.</p><p>En eso, Hall dijo que está “preocupada por los innumerables ejemplos de pruebas de fuego requeridas por las instituciones de educación superior de Utah” al contratar profesores y personal. Eso es lo que dijo que pretende abordar con su propuesta en esta sesión.</p><p>Dijo que ha estado trabajando con “legisladores, el poder ejecutivo, profesores y partes interesadas de la educación superior para comprender mejor los requisitos de la DEI y encontrar un camino a seguir que cree igualdad de oportunidades para todos”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/5/24026683/utah-lawmaker-points-to-university-of-utah-job-postings-in-push-against-diversity-statements\">Hall le dijo recientemente a KSL</a> que le preocupa cuántas ofertas de trabajo para los colegios y universidades públicas del estado requieren que los solicitantes proporcionen un comentario sobre sus creencias en materia de diversidad. Estimó que entre el 15% y el 20% de las solicitudes de la Universidad de Utah incluían eso.</p><p>Un representante examina a todos los empleadores y las creencias de DEI</p><p>Un tercer proyecto de ley para esta sesión analiza la DEI, pero si bien incluye universidades públicas, no se limita solo a ellas.</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/JIMENT/\">El representante Tim Jimenez, republicano por Tooele</a>, quiere asegurarse de que todos los empleadores del estado, tanto públicos como privados, no tengan ningún tipo de requisito para que un empleado firme un documento o marque una casilla prometiendo aceptar cualquier creencia sobre diversidad o inclusión.</p><p>Dijo que los empleadores tienen el derecho de la Primera Enmienda a decir lo que representa su empresa. Pero, añadió, los empleados tienen el mismo derecho a no ser obligados a aceptar algo en lo que no creen.</p><p>Jimenez dijo que escuchó a empleados estatales que expresaron su preocupación por esto, lo que lo impulsó a investigar el tema.</p><p>Lo ve como una continuación de sus esfuerzos de la última sesión, <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0427.html\">con el HB427</a>, centrado en lo que él llama “libertad individual” en la educación. Ese proyecto de ley fue aprobado y promulgado y ahora prohíbe que las escuelas K-12 enseñen a los estudiantes que son responsables de cualquier racismo, sexismo u otra discriminación en el pasado.</p><p>Ese proyecto de ley fue una <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/05/19/protest-over-critical/\">consecuencia del esfuerzo anterior de la Legislatura para prohibir en las escuelas K-12 cualquier discusión sobre la teoría crítica de la raza</a>, un marco académico de nivel universitario que postula que las instituciones del país se formaron a partir de principios racistas. No hay evidencia de que se estuviera enseñando ampliamente aquí.</p><p>Jimenez dijo que su nuevo proyecto de ley ahora toma la misma idea y la traslada al lugar de trabajo.</p><img alt=\"(Foto cortesía) En la foto aparece el representante Tim Jimenez.\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/Snx61VzfR0hqX_tgCOyy5nxAlv4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/WWMIAESAVBAD7CFIXCRQMAD54Q.tif\" /><br /><caption>(Foto cortesía) En la foto aparece el representante Tim Jimenez.</caption><p>Dijo que aún no ha descubierto todos los mecanismos, incluidas las limitaciones que el Estado podría imponer a los empleadores privados.</p><p>“Esa es el área en la que estamos trabajando para que todo esté bien en el idioma”, dijo. “Queremos que la gente tenga trabajo.

Much of the planning and programs are handled regionally by <a href=\"https://www.uasd.org/district-listing/category/water-conservancy-districts-2\" target=\"_blank\">15 water conservancy districts</a> that offer incentives for voluntary conservation measures through individual cities.

Utah’s Division of <a href=\"https://conservewater.utah.gov/landscape-rebates/\" target=\"_blank\">Water Resources</a> notes that “60% of residential water use goes towards outdoor irrigation.”</p><p>Between and within conservancy districts, however, water conservation ordinances can range widely among local entities.

I didn’t even text,” she said. “I didn’t even look at my phone” while watching the episode.</p><p>Asked if she thinks the “RHOSLC” cast members deserve an Oscar for their performance, Lawrence replied, “I’ll give ‘em mine! I don’t care. They deserve it!”</p><p>(Neither Keltin nor Lawrence acknowledged that Osars are for acting, and the Housewives are supposedly not acting — they’re appearing in a “reality” show.)</p><p>In that season finale, cast members Heather Gay, Lisa Barlow, Meredith Marks, Whitney Rose and Angie Katsanevas <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2023/12/10/scott-d-pierce-among-millionaire/\" target=\"_blank\">confronted Monica Garcia</a> —\\xa0who joined the cast in Season 4 — after Heather learned that Monica is behind the infamous Reality Von Tease Instagram account, which has trolled the Housewives viciously for years. After first denying she had any involvement with it, Monica eventually acknowledged that she was one of multiple people who operate the account. She did, however, insist she only posted about <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2023/01/19/victims-real-housewife-slc-jen/\" target=\"_blank\">former cast member Jen Shah</a>, who’s now serving a prison term after confessing to federal fraud charges —\\xa0although the other women did not believe her.</p><p>While being interviewed on the Golden Globes red carpet by Nischelle Turner of “Entertainment Tonight,” Lawrence gave a “shoutout to the best finale I have ever seen on reality TV. Oh my God! Wow.” She even repeated (to the best of her memory) Heather’s performance in the show, which she called “amazing.” </p><p>Lawrence is a fan of multiple iterations of “The Real Housewives. Although that was her favorite season finale, “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” is not her favorite show. “I’m alway partial to Beverly Hills,” Lawrence said. “I’m relieved by the [overhauled] New York crew. ... I think they’re going to round out nicely. Everybody seems to have the right personality disorder that we like to see.</p><p>“I really liked ‘Dallas,’ but nobody else did.” (It was canceled in 2021.)</p><p>She didn’t watch the “RHOSLC” season finale until “a couple days later,” and she was “stone cold sober, because I was starving for this event, and I was jaw dropped.” She effused over the show and the women on it.</p><p>“I want a painting of the moment where they’re all on the beach” as Heather tells Lisa, Meredith and Whitney about Monica’s betrayal. “The different looks (on their faces,” Lawrence said on E!. “It was amazing. And they were like a little band of witches. You know, like, they all fight and they came together for this amazing moment.”</p><p>The three-part Season 4 reunion begins Tuesday on Bravo — 6 p.m. on Dish and Directive; 9 p.m. on Comcast.

These studies reinforce what we instinctively feel when we take hikes in our foothills, harvest apples from our backyard trees, or take a stroll under the tall trees of Liberty Park.</p><p>Utah is a symphony of organizations that aims to increase respectful access to nature in our state. Each instrument in this orchestra offers a unique sound to enrich the quality of our lives and our environment.</p><p>But unlike a real symphony, there is no single conductor who keeps track of which instruments are represented and the pace of the music. Lack of coordination risks potential redundancy or imbalance of efforts, which may lead to territoriality and competition for limited resources among groups working toward the same mission. To avoid that, novice groups must learn about the actions of others and ensure their contribution is distinct.</p><p>One such newcomer is <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nature and Human Health-Utah (NHH-UT)</a>, a research/practice collaborative supported by <a href=\"https://www.reifund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the REI Cooperative Action Fund</a>. NHH-UT was founded in 2019 by Nalini Nadkarni, forest ecologist and Professor Emerita at the University of Utah. Our group is co-lead by Tim Brown, CEO of the Tracy Aviary, and Dart Schmalz, Department Chair of Parks, Recreation and Tourism at the University.</p><p>We founded NHH-UT because we recognized the increasing societal shifts to lifestyles in nature-deficient environments, which has <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/6/585/294707\" target=\"_blank\">negative impacts</a> on both human and environmental health. Although <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28796634/\" target=\"_blank\">recent research documents</a> significant health benefits of nature engagement, there is limited awareness in the traditional healthcare enterprise and the public.</p><p>Because of this limited awareness, NHH-UT’s mission is to understand, articulate and foster relationships between nature and human health by providing a collaborative arena to engage, formulate actions and implement solutions for the people and nature in Utah.</p><p>Because many existing groups in Utah are actively working on this theme, we carried out a <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/landscape-assessment\" target=\"_blank\">landscape assessment</a> to synthesize the missions and actions of 27 groups that represent government, higher education, recreation, environment and health care across the Salt Lake Valley.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>We learned that existing and well-played melodies concern nature and health topics in many harmonious keys. For example, many regional organizations are working towards improving air quality, enhancing access to urban green spaces, and providing access to recreational opportunities in schools and summer camps. Others focus on overcoming existing barriers to nature engagement such as transportation, finances and lack of gear, particularly for groups that have been traditionally underrepresented.</p><p>The surveys and interviews we conducted and synthesized allowed us to identify what is, and — more importantly — what is not yet being done. The majority of groups involved in the landscape assessment expressed interest in NHH-UT being a connector and an amplifier of existing work. Other priorities included additional research in the nascent field of nature and human health, more funding for pilot projects, and finding solutions to equitable nature access concerns. A recurring leitmotif was the need for support through political pathways to promote real, sustainable impacts on nature connections for the betterment of the health of people and the environment.</p><p>In October 2023, NHH-UT hosted <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/symposium\" target=\"_blank\">a symposium </a>designed for groups with similar missions to connect, discuss and reduce overlap. This was the first of many activities NHH-UT will provide to harmonize the efforts that engage people with nature. The keynote speaker at the event was Utah Rep. Rosemary Lesser, who spoke on the need to improve health outcomes through holistic approaches and why we, as Utahns, need to pay particular attention to the health of our environment.</p><p>Additionally, 13 community organizations participated in a poster session during the symposium to highlight the work that is currently being done in nature and health and encourage participants to connect with one another based on the issues that are most important to them.</p><p>We also announced that Nature and Human Health will be awarding a second round of <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/pilot-grants\" target=\"_blank\">pilot grants</a> in 2024 for individuals and/or organizations that would like to implement a project that relates to increasing access to the outdoors to improve the health of Utahns. NHH-UT received 15 proposals for projects related to pediatric rheumatology, air quality, bike lane expansions, camping programs for African American families, nature-based summer camps for incarcerated youth, and mental health outdoor programming for women.</p><p>Our group welcomes continuing input and expertise of all individuals and groups who wish to connect Utahns more closely to nature in effective and harmonious ways.</p><p>Learn more about Nature and Human Health-Utah at <a href=\"http://www.natureandhealthutah.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.natureandhealthutah.org</a>.</p><img alt=\"Nalini Nadkarni\" height=\"2792\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/uxSc7054_ryvhXUrjwOnnnfCGqU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/SNICSCRQAVEMHKFVEX4FX4RUPA.jpg\" width=\"3144\" /><br /><caption>Nalini Nadkarni</caption><p><i><b>Nalini Nadkarni</b></i><i>, co-leader of NHH-UT and Professor Emerita at the University of Utah, has interwoven research on forest canopy biota with innovative public engagement throughout her career.

We opened one back in 1974 that was out of Joe Redburn’s bar, and it lasted like for maybe two years, primarily because the community was just too small to support it.” (Redburn opened The Sun, an iconic Salt Lake City gay bar, in 1973.)</p><p><b>Babs Delay, real estate broker and LGBTQ+ activist •</b> “Myself, Joe Redburn and a few other folks created [the first center] near where the bars were downtown. It was next door to the Sun Tavern, and a bunch of us were concerned about our community. People were getting beat up. People wanted to get together outside of the bar.”</p><p><b>Nikki Boyer, activist, in a 2020 interview, recalling Redburn’s first effort to throw a kegger in 1975 that is considered Utah’s first pride festival •</b> “Queers like to drink beer, let’s face it.

There were 12 of us, and we marched, two-by-two, up over a little grassy knoll with a flag. That was the opening ceremony.”</p><p><b>Williams •</b> “One of the quotes that we used to have at the old Stonewall Center [was] that ‘community meant communication and unity.’ That’s what community was, and I don’t feel like there is much communication or unity in our broader community [today], and it might be because we have so many different issues. … We’re not the same people that we were in the 1990s, when we started the Stonewall Center.”</p><p><b>Sue Robbins, a transgender organizer who joined UPC around 2008 or 2009, through a group of people who weren’t out yet •</b> “I was able to participate in that group and start to find like people who are trying to explore and understand ourselves. … It let me know I wasn’t alone.

The  church has new rules for creating additional congregations. (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>Previously, there were different requirements based on geography inside the United States and Canada or North America and outside of the United States and North America. With this announcement, which goes into effect as of Jan. 1, there will now be a uniform standard for minimum requirements to create new wards and stakes.</p><p>[For stakes] now what that will be is 150 active, full-tithe-paying <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/09/23/learn-lingo-church-jesus-christ/\">Melchizedek Priesthood</a> holders capable of serving in leadership positions. Previously, it was 120 for other countries and 180 for the United States and Canada. Membership now is just going to be 2,000, regardless of what country the stake would be organized in. Previously, it was 3,000 for the U.S. and Canada and 1,900 for other countries.</p><p>Participating adults — this is a new metric required for creating new stakes and wards — and for a stake, it’s 500 adults that are participating adults and youth is 100, although not required for the youth. These are adults that are participating in church regularly, they pay a full <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/03/26/does-tithing-requirement-for-entry-into-lds-temples-amount-to-mormons-buying-their-way-into-heaven/\">tithe</a>, hold a temple recommend, hold a calling. So these are some fairly strict guidelines for being considered a participating adult.</p><p>Now for the wards, previously it was 300 in the United States and Canada in terms of total membership required to create a new ward, 150 for other countries. Now it’s going to be 250 to create a ward and then also the requirement for the number of active, full-tithe-paying Melchizedek Priesthood holders capable of serving leadership positions will be 20 for all areas where wards are created. Before it was 20 for the U.S. and Canada and 15 for other countries. [The recommendation for] participating adults is now 100 and participating youth is 20.</p><p><i><b>What effect do you believe the new rules will have on congregations in the U.S. and Canada?</b></i></p><p>I do think it’s going to make it easier for the church, of course, to organize new wards in terms of raw membership…but it might make it more difficult in terms of participating adults. So these aren’t just adults that go to church regularly. They have a calling, pay a full tithe, have a temple recommend. Those are pretty significant requirements, and that’ll likely result in a decrease in the creation of new wards in the United States and Canada in the coming years.</p><p>You have to have 500 participating adults to create a new stake. And again, that’s a pretty high number…and that might delay the creation of new wards and stakes.</p><p><i><b>How might they affect growth in the rest of the world?</b></i></p><img alt=\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\\nLatter-day Saints in the Democratic Republic of Congo celebrate their temple in the capital of Kinshasa.\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/Lk8B-WkihSPgM9Flz4PedWmIk28=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/6GNC4ZTKYJBUVNMVMJBV5YAWDU.jpg\" width=\"959\" /><br /><caption>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\\nLatter-day Saints in the Democratic Republic of Congo celebrate their temple in the capital of Kinshasa.</caption><p>We’ll likely see a significant decrease in the number of new stakes and wards being created internationally. …It’s going to be much more common probably for stakes to create more branches instead of wards now and then, hoping that these branches can become large enough to become wards, or maybe just focusing more on smaller congregations of branches instead as a way to bypass some of these more stringent qualifications.</p><p><i><b>Are you a fan of the changes and can you think of maybe a reason why they were put in place?</b></i></p><p>One of the things I really like about these requirements is the lower standard for membership in the United States, just because we have many places in the United States where the church functions much more like it would in Europe or in industrialized East Asia than it would in Utah.</p><p>But you also have many stakes that cover large geographical areas in the Plains states and in the Northeast. And this can allow for creating stakes that are not as large geographically and place less of a burden on on stake leadership to visit and work with the members and leaders in these areas.</p><p>It also is great … because it really takes down this barrier or this distinction between the church in the United States and Canada versus everywhere else. The church should be the same everywhere in terms of how it’s administered in a lot of ways.</p><p>I think the reason why these standards have been updated is that really, across the world, one of the biggest challenges that church has had has been finding these participating men that are able to serve in these leadership positions that women cannot serve in.</p><p><i><b>The church’s news release says nothing, at least explicitly, about women or the all-female Relief Society. Should those numbers be part of the equation?</b></i></p><p>That’s a really interesting question. … My initial response to that is that has not been a problem the church has had in terms of participating women. And so I think the reason why these standards have been updated is that, really, across the world, one of the biggest challenges the church has had has been finding these participating men that are able to serve in these leadership positions that women cannot serve in.</p><p><i><b>What messaging does it send by not mentioning women or the Relief Society in the requirements?

I can’t think of any examples of where that’s happened. There are branches that are almost entirely made up of men, and there are branches that are almost entirely made up of women, and that’s not just in a correctional facility setting. That includes branches and isolated areas. For example, there’s a branch in Mongolia that serves a mining complex, and I believe that branch is probably entirely made up of men.</p><p>And then also you have branches that are almost entirely made up of women, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/local/2017/12/24/mormon-congregations-in-hong-kong-unlike-any-others-theyre-virtually-all-women-and-they-dont-just-hold-services-on-sundays/\">especially in Hong Kong</a>. There are branches there where there are housekeepers and women doing those types of jobs there from other countries, a lot of times from the Philippines.</p><p><i><b>Let’s talk about the new study, which made headlines, saying that self-identifying Latter-day Saints make up 42%, less than half, of Utah’s population. What did you think of that finding?</b></i></p><p>I was totally not surprised. That really conforms with what we’ve known about with member activity rates in Utah for decades.</p><p><i><b>What do you think most observers, including researchers, get wrong about Latter-day Saint membership in Utah?</b></i></p><img alt=\"(Photo by Chris Samuels and Graphic by Christopher Cherrington  |  The Salt Lake Tribune)\" height=\"1266\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/zWqU8JU8bO52mJWTLskvFfnEgns=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/73JK2NETURDYVD23MTU7QT3IIU.jpg\" width=\"2268\" /><br /><caption>(Photo by Chris Samuels and Graphic by Christopher Cherrington  |  The Salt Lake Tribune)</caption><p>People think that Utah is homogenous, just everyone is Mormon. And it’s just not correct. It’s never been correct. If you go back to 1920, only 60% of the population of the state of Utah was on church records. That’s lower than it is now.</p><p>It has ebbed and flowed a little bit over time, but roughly speaking in the last century, it’s really been about two thirds of the state population have been on the church’s records as members. And in terms of the activity rate in Utah, that’s typically been about 50% overall for quite some time, at least the last few decades.</p><p>If you take that approximately two-thirds of the state population [are] Latter-day Saints and you take half of that, that’s 33%. That’s lower than the number that’s reported in the study, which was 42%.</p><p>So the thing that was really neat with this study is that then we’re able to get an idea of, OK what are the number of people in Utah who do not appear to attend church really at all or have any measurements of activity — how many of those people still identify as a Latter-day Saint? And that comes out to about 10% of the population of Utah…. There’s been a lot of information that you see on social media where people make it sound like the church is just falling apart. And that’s just not true. … Furthermore, the rate of stakes and wards and branches being created in Utah has been so consistent for the past 20 years at about 400 members per ward or branch in Utah, and that hasn’t really changed much.</p><p><i><b>Where do you peg the activity rate in the church around the world?</b></i></p><p>For the United States, approximately 40%.... For the world as a whole, I’d say about 30%.</p><p><i>To hear the full podcast, go to </i><a href=\"http://sltrib.com/podcasts/mormonland\"><i>sltrib.com/podcasts/mormonland</i></a><i>.

It was made up of some 300 grade school kids at a northern Utah elementary, curious young minds who were gathered at an assembly meant to promote drinking milk and eating nutritious foods.</p><p>Now, that eager, feisty crowd got a bonus — a chance to hear from and ask a real-live NFL quarterback a couple fistfuls of questions, easy and tough ones.</p><p>Programming note: At that point in his career, Smith had done notable, improbable things, including leading the Utah Utes to an undefeated season, being named a college All-American, becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, ascending to the position of starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for a handful of seasons, suffering and fighting his way through difficult injuries, being called soft by his clueless coach — “That was hard to take,” he said — for figuring it was better for him not to play with a serious shoulder separation, tearing three ligaments, and, later, after he recovered, losing his starting job to a fellow named J.T. O’Sullivan, a scrub QB who had been a backup for seven different teams before stealing the wheel from Smith in San Francisco.</p><p>Questions, kids?</p><p>After being asked what he liked to do other than play football — “snowboard, bowl, watch movies and read” — and what he ate for breakfast — “Cinnamon Toast Crunch” — and what his favorite football memory was — “beating BYU my last year at the University of Utah” — and who the hardest team he ever played against was — “I’ve played a lot of hard teams in the NFL” — Smith stared down and stumbled over the most problematic inquiry of all: Why do you like playing football?</p><p>“Um … uh … Good question.”</p><p>At that juncture in his journey, a steamroller of a question.</p><p>As Smith was announced on Sunday as a part of the 2024 class of the College Football Hall of Fame, that question burrowed deep into my mind. He fumbled and bumbled around with it on that particular occasion, but Smith could have responded with a drop-dead sincere, “To set a determined example for those who watch me.”</p><p>If the best quarterback who ever played at Utah is to be remembered for anything, and there are a lot of things in college and in the pros, paramount among his attributes and achievements would be his dogged steadfastness in hacking his way through challenges — and the grace and courage it took to do so.</p><p>Alums and fans of many schools seek to find, embrace and celebrate one of their own of whom they can be proud, and Smith more than qualifies for that status among Utes.</p><p>Who can forget the way he battled back from the cruel leg injury he suffered late in his 16-year NFL career, an injury that literally could have killed the man, subsequently being named the league’s Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.</p><p>That was emblematic of the extremes Smith faced during his pro playing days, overcoming them enough to do more than throw for 35,650 yards and 199 touchdowns, earning three Pro Bowl invitations, while playing for San Francisco, Kansas City and Washington. It garnered for him lofty respect from teammates, most of his coaches, team executives, opposing players and fans. Not bad for a quarterback who initially was labeled by some critics a bust, who was the understudy of four different offensive coordinators over his first four NFL seasons, and who possessed the fortitude to fight on.</p><p>When he spoke to the elementary school kids all those years ago, he openly wondered how a game that had been so good to him at Utah could have turned its back on him, seemingly laughing at his pain, in the NFL. All as he knew he was talented enough, intelligent enough, capable enough to thrive at the highest level of football.</p><p>“It’s been hard,” he said, after the youngsters filed back to class. “When you struggle, when you’re hurt, you’re kind of out of sight, out of mind.”</p><p>Out of sorts.</p><p>It deterred and defeated him not in a manner enough to derail his intentions. He may not have lived up to his 2005 draft position, at least not the way some folks consider it, but Smith’s career passing yardage ranks him among the top 35 NFL quarterbacks all-time.</p><p>Utah — and no other school — could have known completely the vastness of Smith’s future capabilities, being the only FBS school that wanted him just more than 20 years ago, but the Utes did recognize some of his potential and most of his intelligence. Smith eventually was named to the Academic All-America Hall of Fame.</p><p>At the start of the 2003 season, Smith wasn’t even named Utah’s starter — until Brett Elliott got hurt. That’s when he launched into a memorable time at Utah, passing for 5,203 yards and 47 touchdowns, rushing for 1,072 yards and 15 scores. He still holds school records for career pass efficiency (164.42) and yards per completion (13.38). Most significantly, Smith quarterbacked the best team — in 2004 — in Utah’s football history, the team that went unbeaten and won the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1, 2005.</p><p>“I think we would have beaten anybody that year,” he said. “We executed so well. We had athletes. We were so solid. We were good, better even than the [2008] team.”</p><p>As elevated as Smith’s play was — and this says much about him as a humble soul — he said he had no clue the NFL would come calling. “It was surreal. I played that whole season in college and never had a single inkling that the NFL was a possibility.”</p><p>It was … 16 years of it.</p><p>And that span, that reach, gave Smith an opportunity to expand the example of his dogged courage and determination beyond football, starting a foundation that provides foster teens with tools necessary to transition to successful adulthood via means such as education, mentoring, advocacy, etc.</p><p>When Smith was inducted into the Utah Athletics Hall of Fame a few years back, he said: “One school gave me a chance. That was the U. and I’m grateful for it. It changed my life, shaped who I am today.”</p><p>Ahh. That pretty much satisfies the schoolboy’s long-ago question, the one regarding why Alex Smith liked playing football.</p><p>Good question then. Good answer now.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Here’s what a day in the life of the Utah Jazz dancers looks like',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Here’s what a day in the life of the Utah Jazz dancers looks like'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Palak Jayswal'}],\n   'author': 'Palak Jayswal',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Palak Jayswal'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 18:52:58 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=18, tm_min=52, tm_sec=58, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'A day with the Utah Jazz Dancers, from solitary rehearsal time in an empty arena to performing in front of thousands in the Delta Center — putting in the work while knowing \"we\\'re not the main event.\"',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'A day with the Utah Jazz Dancers, from solitary rehearsal time in an empty arena to performing in front of thousands in the Delta Center — putting in the work while knowing \"we\\'re not the main event.\"'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Like most sports teams, the Utah Jazz Dancers have their pre-game rituals.</p><p>Team captain Halle Santiago leads 21 other dancers through their warmups, before the state’s NBA franchise hosts the Brooklyn Nets at Delta Center on Dec. 18.</p><p>The room where they warm up is also their dressing room, where an hour earlier the dancers sat on the floor, in front of mirrors, curling their hair and applying mascara and the red lipstick that matches the holiday-themed outfits hanging above them in their cubbies.

For example, the dancers’ moves for the 90-second player introductions change with every game, she said.</p><p>Standing in the tunnel leading to the court, Kelson — clad in a velvet green blazer for the holidays — dons her headset, which she uses to listen to the Jazz’s director of game presentation, listening for cues to hold before entering the arena.</p><p>Kelson tells the dancers that after the first quarter, they will convene on the “porch” — the mezzanine area of the concourse, where fans can see them — and they can watch the game. Before their warmups, some dancers were on the “porch,” posing for photos with fans.</p><p>They wait in the tunnel, alongside the Jazz’s stunt team (coached by Summer Wilson, who’s also the coach of Weber State’s <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2022/04/04/weber-states-spirit-team/\">award-winning</a> spirit team). Within moments, they’re racing onto the court, and getting the crowd hyped during that 90-second intro.</p><p>It happens in a rush, along with everything else that happens on the court before a game starts.

(Rick Egan/)</caption><p>During every Jazz home game, Kelson said, the dancers perform intros, timeout routines, longer dance numbers — whatever the situation calls for, and sometimes depending on that game’s theme.</p><p>The dancers memorize some 40 or 50 routines every season, Kelson said, sometimes repeating a few. Practice starts in August, and by the first game in October, they will have 25 routines ready to go. The effortlessness displayed during games is the result, she said, of four-hour practice sessions twice a week.</p><p>For the Dec. 18 game, with the holiday theme, the dancers were given more time to perform, Kelson said. The halftime performance was longer than usual, set to a playlist of holiday songs that included Mariah Carey, Elton John, Wham!, NSYNC and Britney Spears.</p><p>Dancing to Christmas music, and making that performance fun and engaging, is a feat in itself — and being able to do so is one of this team’s strengths, Kelson said.</p><p>“With the personalities that are a part of this year’s group,” Kelson said, she’s struck by “how adaptable they are. [They’re] quick learners.”</p><p>Kelson has been the team’s coach for seven seasons, and she was a dancer for the Jazz for five seasons. Kelson attended the University of Utah, and trained in the U.’s dance program.</p><p>When her time dancing for the Jazz ended, Kelson said she wanted to stay in sports, which led to her involvement with sports sponsorships. She approached Steve Starks, then the team’s president (now the CEO of the Larry H. Miller Company), about growing the Jazz Dancers program. After giving a presentation, Kelson said, Starks asked her to lead the team.</p><p>“We’re just trying to grow and evolve the program,” Kelson said. “From where I was as a dancer, I don’t know if I could keep up with half of the routines the current dancers are doing right now.”</p><p>Kelson’s rapport with the dancers is evident. During their afternoon rehearsals before the Brooklyn game, the coach and the dancers communicate about what is and isn’t working. They practice their spacing, being careful to stay within a narrow section of the court because space is precious. They refer to lines on the court that aren’t visible from the stands or on TV.</p><p>The dancers fine-tune their moves, making sure angles are clean, marks are hit, poses are crisp, as their matching white Nike sneakers hit the floor in rhythm.</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune)\" height=\"3959\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/UvIylXJ-doFnXzU_WUXZzeO_p_s=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/APGPAVTJKVFKFEALBUXZRGWCC4.JPG\" width=\"5938\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>The team’s work extends beyond the court, Kelson said.</p><p>“There’s a lot that goes in business hours outside of practice and games as well,” Kelson said. “Besides showing up many hours before tipoff on a game day, they are heavily involved in community appearances” — such as volunteering at VA hospitals or with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. “The importance of being a role model to youth is so important,” she said.</p><p>Meet the dancers</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/jazz/dancers\">dancers on the team</a> are young, their ages ranging from 18 to 27. Some are full-time students, while others have jobs outside their obligations as Jazz Dancers. (The dancers are compensated, a representative of the Jazz’s corporate communications team said, but the franchise would not disclose how much they’re paid.)</p><p>Jayden Herman, for example, is in his second season with the dance team, helps coach drill teams at Cyprus and Granger high schools, and works as a manager at <a href=\"https://fiizdrinks.com/\">FiiZ drinks</a>. Herman said dedication, passion and the time commitment are a big part of the job.</p><p>“My senior year, I was actually the first boy on our drill team at Granger High School,” Herman said. Though he tried out and made it, he wasn’t able to perform at things outside school events. “They said that I wasn’t allowed to compete because it was a sanctioned only-girls sport, but it was still fun,” he explained.</p><p>Herman is one of three male dancers on the Jazz’s squad. Male dancers first appeared on the team in the 2021-2022 season, though Kelson said they were always allowed to join. She said it was a natural next step for where the program is going.</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jayden Herman performs with the Utah Jazz Dancers on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024.\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/7moE9ayNqXB-Hk059cN7sXUScys=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/ICJHUWNNFNAH7FYDJO2INXZHWQ.JPG\" width=\"2500\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jayden Herman performs with the Utah Jazz Dancers on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024.

The team’s first Black dancers <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/jazz/dancers?t=1617\">joined in 2016</a>; this season’s team has several performers of color. (The Utah Jazz have long been at the center of conversations about Utah’s racial culture. For example, former Jazz star Donovan Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/01/10/donovan-mitchell-draining/\">made news in early 2023</a> when he discussed the pressure he felt as a well-known Black person in Utah.)</p><p>“We are always looking for the best dancer — not only dancer, but well-rounded person in general,” Kelson said. “It’s not all about the dance, and it’s not all about looks, per se, but, you know, how is their mental health? Can they handle criticism of what a fan might say?”</p><p>Auditions are held every year, before the season starts. This season, 11 team members are rookies, and 11 are returning performers.</p><p>“You have to have the skill. You have to have the talent,” said Santiago, who is returning for her third season with the Jazz Dancers, and her second as team captain. “They’re looking for very well-trained professional dancers, but they’re also looking for amazing people.”</p><p>(One indication of their dance skills can be seen in a video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/utahjazzdancers/\">the team’s Instagram account</a> — in which dancers try to guess what choreography a teammate is performing behind them, going only by the sound of their feet on the floor.)</p><p>Santiago — who’s from Provo and also teaches dance — said she loves that she gets to dance in her home state.</p><p>“I grew up dancing collegiately, and so coming from that, my favorite part of that was being at the sporting events,” said Santiago, a former member of the <a href=\"https://byucougars.com/sports/cougarettes\">Brigham Young University Cougarettes</a>. “I’ve always had my eye on the Jazz Dancers, just because Utah is known for their dance.

(Rick Egan/)</caption><p>The Jazz Dancers also deal with the reality that they are just one part of the spectacle of an NBA game — and that fans may be more focused on the players, or heading to the concession stands, while the dancers are performing.</p><p>“It’s always the bigger picture, with entertainment and everything,” Kelson said. “People are coming to see a game, and so we understand. … Yes, unfortunately, we aren’t the main event.”</p><p>The ultimate goal for the Jazz Dancers, Kelson said, is to create connections — whether fans see them on the court, on the concourse or in public appearances around the community.</p><p>“The more we can build those relationships and those connections,” Kelson said, “we can trick them a little bit to stay in their seats a little bit longer.”</p><p>Santiago noted that “no one’s ever going to really realize what it takes to get to this level. They just see the pretty package with the bow tied on top.”</p><p>As a dancer, Santiago said, “The work is always more than worth it. … It’s not gratification from the outside. It’s definitely gratification from the inside, and all the work that we put in even when no one’s watching.”</p><p>When the Jazz Dancers step on to the court at halftime on Dec. 18, a lot is happening. Bear, the Jazz mascot, is incorporated into the dancers’ routine — acting as the DJ, flipping through the songs they’re dancing to. Those fans who have stayed to watch are singing along to the holiday hits.</p><p>It all comes together, with wild waves of hair, dazzling smiles and perfect execution.</p><p>During the second half, the dancers return to the court during timeouts, deploying a t-shirt cannon to give out prizes. By the end of the night, fans got another prize: The Jazz beat the Nets, 125-108 — the first of five wins over the team’s last seven games of December.</p><p>“When a fan comes in,” Kelson said, “it’s more than just seeing a person in a really pretty uniform. It’s not just about dance — but who these dancers are, even outside of this, and how hard they’re working at their jobs or trying to get an education or helping their families out.”</p><p>Santiago said, “People just see the glitz and glam of it all and think, ‘Oh, they’re just these pretty dancers on the court.’ … We’re hard-working athletes. We put in a lot of time and effort and energy outside of practice to get to that pretty picture.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

McCarthy</a> are both so talented, and yet, they could not be more different. One thing is for sure, though: They are both likely to play on Sundays, only adding to the high stakes for the College Football Playoff final.</p><p>Granted, McCarthy has not announced his intentions yet and has until Jan. 15 to do so, but for the sake of this discussion, let’s assume he’s going to enter the 2024 NFL Draft. Here’s how I see the two QBs entering the biggest game of their careers.</p><p></p><p>Michael Penix Jr. (6-foot-3, 212 pounds)</p><img alt=\"Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. looks to throw against Washington State during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)\" height=\"4241\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/CF97-xzmgAycQCQzcLRYDJHtAEM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/7C2I6RTKTPUG7G7EENC52ROLJM.jpg\" width=\"6362\" /><br /><caption>Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. looks to throw against Washington State during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) (Lindsey Wasson/)</caption><p>Penix operates very comfortably from the pocket. He can buy time with subtle movements or even tuck the ball and run for a first down. He seldom seems to panic and is often effective late in the down. He has the arm strength to make all the throws, and he’s had the best deep ball in college football this year. He has a natural feel for the correct trajectory and touch on most throws. That is hard to coach. He also has the arm strength and confidence to fit balls into tight windows from either college hash and can be surgical with his accuracy and ball placement.</p><p>An underrated trait is his ability to alter his arm angle and get the ball out quickly. Watching left-handed quarterbacks can sometimes play tricks on even the best evaluators because they don’t see a lot of releases from that side. To me, one question Penix answered recently is his ability to throw without having his feet set or under him. Some see his delivery as being a little long, but I think it can be sped up, and at times, he shows he can really get the ball out of his hand quickly.</p><p>Penix has excellent vision downfield in identifying targets and reading coverage. His decision-making is solid, and because of his patience, he can let plays develop before he pulls the trigger. His anticipation and trust in his receivers and the system allow him to make some throws that are impossible to defend. You rarely see this at the college level. The word that best describes Penix for me is <i>polished</i>.</p><p>J.J. McCarthy (6-3, 202)</p><img alt=\"Michigan quarterback J.J.

McCarthy (9) throws against Indiana in the first half of an NCAA college football game in Ann Arbor, Mich., Saturday, Oct. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Paul Sancya/)</caption><p>McCarthy has an advantage in this comparison with his legs. He can make things happen on scrambles and designed QB runs in a more explosive way than Penix. He can elude pressure, but at times, he seems hurried and will bolt too quickly.</p><p>He has a really strong arm, even by NFL standards. Tight-window throws and confidence are not an issue. Sometimes, McCarthy will take an unneeded risk because he thinks he can make any throw, but I get it. He has an easy throwing motion; the ball comes off his hand smoothly, and I definitely consider him a <i>passer</i> as opposed to a <i>thrower</i> (there is a difference). He has a feel for touch on shorter routes and throws a catchable ball for the most part. He does not have many targets with top-level NFL ball skills, so some incompletions will become completions at the next level.</p><p>McCarthy has good vision downfield from the pocket, but a lot of his throws have come off of play-action or on RPOs where targets are predetermined. That means there is slightly less on his shoulders to determine who to throw to. The play call often decides where the ball is going, and he knows this before he leaves the huddle. He has natural instincts and feel in the pocket, vision downfield and the ability to anticipate receivers coming open, so I have no doubt about him in a timing-based offensive scheme, especially once he has more experience.</p><p>Factoring schemes and responsibilities</p><img alt=\"(Butch Dill | AP) Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. celebrates after the Sugar Bowl CFP NCAA semifinal college football game between Washington and Texas, Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024, in New Orleans.

Washington won 37-31. (Butch Dill/)</caption><p>Penix is a sixth-year player who spent his first four seasons at Indiana, all of which <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5166936/2023/12/29/michael-penix-washington-indiana-emotional-physical-health/\">ended with injuries</a> (which will affect his status with some NFL teams), before following Kalen DeBoer — the former Hoosiers offensive coordinator who is now the Huskies’ head coach — to Washington <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5181121/2024/01/05/michael-penix-washington-transfer-portal-will-rogers/\">via the transfer portal</a>. Sometimes, the NFL frowns on players who spend an extra year in college, but in my opinion, it has helped Penix in so many ways. He has clearly mastered this offensive scheme, and it took time to build the confidence and poise he now shows.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/team/indiana-hoosiers-college-football/\">Indiana</a>, these results were not possible. Penix lacked the pocket presence and the ability to process information like he will need to at the next level. But now, he has reached the top tier of the learning curve. He might be the most polished of all quarterbacks in this draft class — at least from the pocket — and that includes everyone’s presumed No. 1 choice, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/player/caleb-williams-oOKwyoc07OTLmXZN/\">Caleb Williams</a> from <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/team/usc-trojans-college-football/\">USC</a>. Penix has proved he can operate from the pocket, whether clean or muddy, at a different level.</p><p>McCarthy’s path here has been much different. He is just three years removed from high school and 20 years old. His tools — off-the-charts arm strength and athleticism to extend plays and produce on designed runs — are his calling card. He has less than half as many pass attempts (695) as Penix (1,634), so naturally his processing speed is a bit behind the Huskies QB.</p><p>Here is the other side of that coin, though: NFL evaluators can identify McCarthy’s traits, and his lack of reps might give him a higher ceiling once he masters his trade. Where would he be in Year 6 of his development? It makes for a fascinating comparison that will no doubt lead to hours of discussion within NFL buildings if McCarthy does enter the draft this year.</p><p>Some scouts struggle with the lack of sophistication of the Wolverines’ passing game, especially compared to Washington’s and what Penix is asked to do. I think McCarthy has been asked to do less when it comes to pre-snap administration of the offense. Penix runs a master class managing the Huskies’ offense before the snap, overseeing varied alignments, motions and shifts, and gathering pass protection intel. I have no doubt McCarthy can do the same — it just requires a leap of faith because it’s not as evident at this point.</p><p>Put another way, Penix runs a system that accentuates his skills perfectly and has a proven track record of production to go with his talent. As we saw in the semifinal game, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5173921/2024/01/02/washington-texas-sugar-bowl-score-result-takeaways/\">he is playing at a very high level</a>. Meanwhile, McCarthy runs a system that might not be perfect for his talent or skill set, which will require more projection when assessing him at the next level in a more complicated system.</p><p>Assessing intangibles</p><img alt=\"Michigan quarterback J.J.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (AJ Mast/)</caption><p>NFL scouts are much further along in gathering intangible information on Penix. He has been listed with all other senior prospects all year long. This means scouts have been able to ask Washington coaches and staffers questions — about Penix’s background information, leadership, work habits, medical information, etc. — freely on school visits throughout the fall.</p><p>That information is very tricky to gather on players who might be returning for another year, like McCarthy, especially at a place like Michigan, which has been known to not always be open with its information to visiting scouts. Gathering character and background information on McCarthy is a much different process for scouts than it was for Penix.</p><p>Off-field information is a big part of the evaluation process. Those of us on the outside are not as plugged in as scouts and NFL executives, and for quarterbacks, this part of their file might be even more important than their arm strength. If these things check out, I could see either of these guys being top-10 picks, maybe even higher, in April.</p><p>Comparisons</p><p>NFL decision-makers usually like their scouts to give some type of reference or comparison to another player at the same position with a similar style of game. For example, I used John Elway as a comparison for <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/josh-allen-9zLTUSPpy6pFa4xs/\">Josh Allen</a> when he was coming out. That didn’t mean I saw Allen as another Elway. It meant that Allen’s size, style and skill set were similar to Elway’s. <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> defensive coordinator Vic Fangio made the same comparison this week in preparing for their game against the <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/bills/\">Bills</a>.</p><p>For McCarthy, I see the upside of a Jim Kelly, if he were to be inserted into the K-Gun system of yesteryear’s Buffalo Bills. For younger readers, he’s a less polished <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/cj-stroud-OiILdmCU0Ie4L8vg/\">C.J. Stroud</a>, with major upside.</p><p>As for Penix, I’m dating myself again, but he reminds me of another Huskies great: He is a left-handed Warren Moon with an uncanny ability to throw the deep ball and instincts and touch that can’t be coached.</p><p>Bottom line</p><p>Trying to predict how Penix and McCarthy will be picked without a complete evaluation is really difficult. Their talent tells me they are worthy of being top-10 picks, but that will be affected by the quality of the draft at other positions as well.</p><p>With certainty though, a college game of this magnitude will carry more weight than almost any other in the eyes of coaches and scouts. Bright lights are a big part of any evaluation. Teams will decide who is the best fit for their systems. One player might be more polished, but the other might have more upside.</p><p>The order of QB1 through QB5 in this class is about to get interesting in draft rooms across the NFL.

Cox said he is concerned by how much money is spent on the diversity offices at Utah’s schools and suggested he hasn’t seen the outcomes to support that funding.

(Bethany Baker/)</caption><p>At the time Johnson said he recognized his proposal was “too harsh” and promised to crowdsource and revise it for this year.</p><p>Johnson told The Salt Lake Tribune that he has done that, though he said he still is working out final details and declined to comment specifically on what the bill aims at. “I still kind of want to be flexible,” he said.</p><p>But the senator said that his bill will tackle what he sees as “fairness for everybody” at public colleges. He believes when university offices support specific student populations, like Latino or Black students, it is divisive and exclusionary to others.</p><p>“We need to focus efforts at universities on students and individuals, rather than groups,” he said. “It needs to be focused and fair to everyone.”</p><p>He said he has heard that more students of color are first-generation college students than white students, which is true. But instead of focusing on those students of color, he said, and excluding white students who might also be the first in their families to attend school, he would rather see an office for all first-generation students — which he sees as making access more broad and available to all instead of a few.</p><p>Similarly, he would rather see efforts to support students from families living below the poverty level than offices based on race or ethnicity. He described it as “basing it on a demographic characteristic rather than the color of someone’s skin.”</p><p>Johnson said he doesn’t want state money spent “to help one group over another simply because of their membership to a group.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/27/republican-lawmaker-pulls-his-too/\" target=\"_blank\">Last year, Johnson said roughly $11 million is spent on DEI programs </a>at Utah colleges and universities every year — a number he said came from legislative research. That is taxpayer funded, and he feels there is an obligation to spend it in a way that yields notable results.</p><p>When asked what outcomes a DEI office would need to show to be seen as successful, Johnson did not have specific examples but instead pointed to the governor also questioning what metrics the programs are hitting.</p><p>“There’s a clear role of education and making people better citizens and more productive citizens,” Johnson said. “And if we don’t have a return on that investment, we have to ask ourselves, why are we doing this? What are we getting in return?”</p><p>He said part of his drive, too, comes from the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling to ban affirmative action — meant to open opportunities for individuals from minority and underrepresented backgrounds — with university acceptances. He would like to see colleges, in general, stop focusing on race.</p><p>He feels, with those efforts, higher education has moved away from its mission to educate students — and has started to be biased against conservatives who attend or work there. He says they need to do more to embrace “viewpoint diversity.”</p><p>“This is a case where the pendulum has swung too far from where it was,” he said.</p><p>Johnson started as a professor at the University of Mississippi. He took a break, started a software company, and then returned as a professor at Utah State University. In the time in between, he said: “Having been inside that system and seen what’s happening, it’s more difficult for a conservative within the system than it was when I first started.”</p><p>He said he supports the recent initiative measure from the Utah System of Higher Education that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/02/gov-cox-doesnt-want-utah-colleges/\" target=\"_blank\">mandates the leadership of public universities in the state be neutral on political issues</a>. It also puts limitations on student speech, including that one group cannot shout down another — even if they disagree on an issue or feel it’s hate speech.</p><p>That came after <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/11/17/university-utah-withdrew-its/\" target=\"_blank\">a student group at the University of Utah, MECHA, had its sponsorship pulled </a>after the school said it disrupted a conservative club’s event that was critical of the transgender community.</p><p>Johnson said he wants to see universities embrace and support “viewpoint diversity” going forward.</p><p>Another legislator looks at university ‘litmus tests’</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/HALLK/\" target=\"_blank\">Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden,</a> similarly ran a bill on DEI last session that she is looking to revive.</p><p>Her previous attempt sought to ban schools — both public colleges and K-12 schools — from asking an applicant anything about their work to further inclusion and diversity. It passed through the House, but got held up in a Senate committee.</p><p>The idea was in line with what Cox has recently been targeting in his statements.</p><p>Hall did not respond to several requests to talk to The Tribune for this story, but a spokesperson for the Utah House sent a statement from her.</p><p>In that, Hall said she is “concerned by the countless examples of litmus tests required by Utah’s higher education institutions” in hiring faculty and staff. That’s what she said she intends to look at with her proposal this session.</p><p>She said she has been working with “lawmakers, the executive branch, professors, and higher education stakeholders to better understand DEI requirements and find a path forward that creates equal opportunities for all.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/5/24026683/utah-lawmaker-points-to-university-of-utah-job-postings-in-push-against-diversity-statements\" target=\"_blank\">Hall recently told KSL</a> that she is worried by how many job postings for the state’s public colleges and universities require applicants to provide a comment on their diversity beliefs. She estimated that 15-20% of the University of Utah’s applications included that.</p><p>A representative examines all employers and DEI beliefs</p><p>A third bill for this session looks at DEI — but while it includes public universities, it isn’t limited to just them.</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/JIMENT/\" target=\"_blank\">Rep. Tim Jimenez, R-Tooele,</a> wants to make sure that all employers in the state, both public and private, do not have any kind of requirement for an employee to sign a paper or check a box promising to agree to any beliefs on diversity or inclusion.</p><p>He said employers have a First Amendment right to say what their company stands for. But, he added, employees have the same right not to be compelled to agree to something they don’t believe.</p><p>Jimenez said he has heard from state employees who have expressed concern about this, which spurred him to look into the issue.</p><p>He sees it as a continuation of his efforts from last session, with <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0427.html\" target=\"_blank\">HB427</a>, focused on what he calls “individual freedom” in education. That bill passed and was signed into law and now prohibits K-12 schools from teaching students that they are responsible for any past racism, sexism or other discrimination.</p><p>That bill was an offshoot of<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/05/19/protest-over-critical/\" target=\"_blank\"> the Legislature’s earlier effort to ban from K-12 schools any discussion of critical race theory</a>, a college-level academic framework that posits that the country’s institutions were formed from racist principles. There is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2022/10/21/utah-auditors-see-no-evidence/\" target=\"_blank\">no evidence that was being widely taught here.</a></p><p>Jimenez said his new bill now takes that same idea and puts it in the workplace.</p><img alt=\"(Courtesy photo) Pictured is Rep.

Nacua was then substituted out of the game.</p><p>Nacua will end his rookie season with new high marks of 105 catches and 1,486 yards.</p><p>The Rams won the game 21020.</p><p>A fifth-round draft pick out of Brigham Young, Nacua has recorded over 100 yards in seven games this season, tying the rookie record set by Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 and matched by Justin Jefferson in 2020 (both first-round draft picks). With receiver Cooper Kupp recovering from a hamstring injury to start the 2023 season, Nacua burst onto the NFL scene. His 59 catches in his first eight games set an NFL record for all players. Entering the Week 18 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, Nacua ranked No. 4 in receiving yards (1,445) and No. 8 in catches (101).</p><p>The Rams sat several starters Sunday because they are assured a playoff spot next week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, Kupp, running back Kyren Williams, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and inside linebacker Ernest Jones all were out. Tight end Tyler Higbee (shoulder) and offensive lineman Joe Noteboom (foot) also didn’t play due to injuries. The 49ers also elected to rest starting quarterback Brock Purdy ahead of their playoff stretch.</p><p>Carson Wentz, whom the Rams signed during their Week 10 bye, started for them on Sunday.</p><p>Wednesday, Wentz said “we’ll do our best” to get Nacua the record, adding, “he’s a stud. Puka’s been a stud. Seeing it from afar, but then coming in here and seeing it up close and personal … I don’t know if he really knows how good he is. He’s still a kid, but I think the sky’s the limit for him and it’s cool that he’s getting the recognition that he is and hopefully he can get that record.”</p><p>Rams coach Sean McVay also said Wednesday that the team would be “smart with” Nacua although they wanted to give him the opportunity to “do something special.”</p><p>There’s another interesting layer to Nacua’s milestone. Some senior members of the Rams’ scouting department, plus general manager Les Snead, once worked with Groman after his playing days in Atlanta.</p><p>Snead and senior personnel executives Brian Xanders and Taylor Morton learned from Groman in the Falcons scouting department and Morton ultimately was promoted to Southwest area scout upon Groman’s retirement in 2003. Groman was deeply admired by the three younger scouts.</p><p>Twenty years later, Snead, Morton and Xanders were among those with the Rams who scouted and drafted the player who broke Groman’s record.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Athletic'}],\n   'author': 'The Athletic',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Athletic'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:24:10 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=0, tm_min=24, tm_sec=10, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Former Utah quarterback Alex Smith and former Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss are the first two inductees announced for the College Football Hall of Fame's 2024 class.

I mean, I’m human,” George said Saturday night after totaling six points, three assists, and two rebounds in 16:01 of court time against the Sixers. “It’s gonna take some time to get back to where I was and try to figure out times be aggressive and times where you’re trying to get people involved.”</p><p>His performance vs. Philly was a microcosm of his play since his return.</p><p>It was assumed upon George being cleared for action that his bench role was temporary, a protective measure enacted as he navigated training staff-imposed minutes restrictions and regained his game conditioning and timing.</p><p>Teammate <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/12/27/utah-jazz-coach-will-hardy-mightve/\" target=\"_blank\">Collin Sexton</a>’s recent explosion of efficient productivity, though, threw a wrench into those plans. While Sexton has impressed with his energy and newfound equilibrium, the rookie George often has struggled to impact games.</p><p>“Keyonte found <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/12/11/utah-jazz-rookie-keyonte-georges/\" target=\"_blank\">a rhythm as a starter in terms of his aggressiveness on the offensive end</a>. … I feel like since he’s come back, he’s probably been a little bit careful with the ball,” head coach Will Hardy said before facing Philadelphia. “He’s been a little bit passive in terms of looking for his own shot, especially if he misses a few. And we’re trying to break him of that habit.”</p><p>The coach elaborated that a 50% shooter in the league typically doesn’t follow a miss one/make one/miss one/make one pattern. Players sometimes brick in bunches, but they need to maintain the mindset that the next one will go in if they are to remain effective.</p><p>“Keyonte will have moments where he’ll miss a few shots in a row and then he sort of backs off,” Hardy added. “That comes from a good place. He’s a good player, he has a good concept of being a part of the team, he likes to move the ball. [But] when he doesn’t see a few go in, I think he starts to overcompensate a little bit.”</p><p>In Saturday’s first half, George was on the court for all of 6 minutes and 27 seconds, and frankly was mostly invisible during that time, garnering two defensive rebounds, committing two turnovers, and attempting zero field goals.</p><p>His Jazz teammates know he is trying to navigate how best to help the team without trying to force the action. And they are making it a point to be encouraging.</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune)  Utah Jazz guard Keyonte George (3) guards Detroit Pistons guard Alec Burks (14), in NBA action between the Detroit Pistons and the Utah Jazz, at the Delta Center, on Wednesday, January 3, 2024.\\n\" height=\"4811\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/RyFmya2ygCeTPXLfmbGrztNkzLY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/LFUWHWQFARHLJHAIK4PSRTPIEU.JPG\" width=\"6770\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune)  Utah Jazz guard Keyonte George (3) guards Detroit Pistons guard Alec Burks (14), in NBA action between the Detroit Pistons and the Utah Jazz, at the Delta Center, on Wednesday, January 3, 2024.\\n (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>“It’s an adjustment mentally. Obviously, you’re coming into this league, you’re playing against the best 400 players in the world,” said John Collins, who had 19 points on 9-for-10 shooting Saturday. “… Key obviously belongs in this league and belongs on the court. Really, it’s the mental grind for him.”</p><p>Sexton is making it a point to repeat the same message ad nauseum: Don’t compound mistakes with piled-on self-doubt, just trust in yourself and your teammates.</p><p>“That’s something that I keep telling him: ‘Yo, on to the next play. Continue to fight. We believe in you,’” said Sexton. “… The more you play, the more possessions, the more minutes you have, you’re going to start seeing your game elevate.”</p><p>Hardy knows that George is thinking entirely too much sometimes of late, rather than playing instinctually.</p><p>And he knows precisely why, too.</p><p>“I’ve said to him a lot: ‘You have a hard job as a lead guard, because I want you to shoot <i>and</i> pass on every play,’” Hardy said. “That’s just the way it goes.”</p><p>“He’s got it spot-on,” George conceded with a chagrined smile when told of the comment.</p><p>But that’s something he needs to get used to, his coach continued. Being in the second unit with noted gunner Jordan Clarkson <i>can’t</i> become an excuse to be deferential. Neither can being in the starting lineup alongside All-Star Lauri Markkanen, for that matter.</p><p>“He’s playing with good players. There’s no excuse,” said Hardy. “If you want to be on a good team, you’re going to play alongside other good players, and so he’s learning that now.”</p><p>And George is, indeed, learning.</p><p>Following that ineffectual stint before the break Saturday, something seemed to flip when he checked in with 4:29 left in the third quarter.</p><p>“I think today was, in the second half, one of my more aggressive games as far as getting downhill,” said George. “Everything’s starting to come back together.”</p><p>It began with a jab-step against Sixers star Tyrese Maxey on the perimeter, then utilizing a screen to fly down a wide-open lane. The ensuing slam at the 2:50 mark of the third was George’s first field-goal attempt of the game.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">nothing but room for take off 🛫<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TakeNote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TakeNote</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keyonte1george?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@keyonte1george</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jSmGHufRIa\">pic.twitter.com/jSmGHufRIa</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743820753160777980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>About a minute and a half later, he fired away from 3 and missed, but didn’t get any less aggressive.</p><p>A subsequent possession saw him swiftly move the ball, and he wound up with a hockey assist, as his pass to Ochai Agbaji was forwarded on to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/04/kelly-olynyk-his-wife-reunited/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Olynyk</a> for a made 3-pointer.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, he nicely executed the two-man game with Walker Kessler, taking a screen from the big man, occupying both Maxey and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/07/10/sixers-match-utah-jazzs-offer/\" target=\"_blank\">center Paul Reed</a>, and then feeding Kessler for a slam.</p><p>Later on, George got yet another screen from Kessler, this time on noted defender Patrick Beverley, and as he went around, he attacked the space between Nic Batum and Reed and didn’t hesitate to put up a midrange runner that dropped in.</p><p>Not quite 4 minutes into the fourth, another screen set him up to beat Maxey off dribble going left, after which he charged down the lane, drew multiple defenders, and flung a well-placed pass to Agbaji in the far corner for a 3-point try.</p><p>And a half-minute after that, he took a pass from Kessler and quickly moved it on to Markkanen in the other corner, this time for a made triple that put Utah up 105-91.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">pass<br />pass<br />catch &amp; 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘵 <a href=\"https://t.co/BhdvxtORXu\">pic.twitter.com/BhdvxtORXu</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743823069788201426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>On this occasion, George said, it wasn’t a pep talk from any teammate or coach that got him to dial up the aggression.</p><p>“That was a conversation with myself, to be honest,” he said.</p><p>Hardy thought the timing was perfect considering the opponent, as he views Maxey’s progress as a blueprint for what’s possible with George.</p><p>A combo guard drafted in the middle of the first round, Maxey had to learn that same balance between when to defer to talented teammates such as Joel Embiid and James Harden, and when to exploit the scoring opportunities being presented to him.</p><p>And now, Maxey is having a transcendent breakthrough, averaging 25.9 points and 6.6 assists while shooting 37.4% from 3 as Philly’s No. 2 option behind the reigning MVP.</p><p>George is clearly a bit away from that right now.</p><p>But stringing together more and more moments like the ones he had in the second half against the Sixers could potentially get him there.</p><p>“We’re trying to just regain that aggressiveness when he’s on the floor that he had before he got injured. Right now I’m seeing a little bit of what we saw at the beginning of the year with him, where he has flashes of aggression but can also kind of fade back into the background a little bit. So it’s going to be a little bit of a work in progress,” said Hardy. “… He’s in a spot that I would anticipate — there’s nights where the balance is good, and there’s nights where he defers to the veteran guys. We’re trying to help him work through that, help him see the film and recognize that it’s OK to be aggressive when the game tells you to be aggressive.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Opinion: It’s time we all discovered Great Salt Lake’s sacred significance',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Opinion: It’s time we all discovered Great Salt Lake’s sacred significance'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-utahs-faith-groups-are/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-utahs-faith-groups-are/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/07/opinion-utahs-faith-groups-are/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Great Salt Lake Interfaith Action Coalition | For The Salt Lake Tribune'}],\n   'author': 'The Great Salt Lake Interfaith Action Coalition | For The Salt Lake Tribune',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Great Salt Lake Interfaith Action Coalition | For The Salt Lake Tribune'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 22:59:55 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=22, tm_min=59, tm_sec=55, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '“It is our obligation to act as guardians and stewards of the Earth, not as its masters,” writes The Great Salt Lake Interfaith Action Coalition. “It is time to rekindle our wonder, awe and reverence for Great Salt Lake.”',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': '“It is our obligation to act as guardians and stewards of the Earth, not as its masters,” writes The Great Salt Lake Interfaith Action Coalition. “It is time to rekindle our wonder, awe and reverence for Great Salt Lake.”'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><i>“Treat the earth well: It was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children.” —</i><a href=\"https://www.lakotatimes.com/articles/tasunke-witko-crazy-horse/\" target=\"_blank\"><i> Tasunke Witko</i></a></p><p>In 2009, members of Utah’s diverse religious communities <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/FaithandtheLandStatement\" target=\"_blank\">developed a statement</a> in which they wrote, “Despite differences in the beliefs and practices that define our traditions, we share a common experience and conviction that wilderness is a place of profound spiritual inspiration, renewal, connection and nourishment.

In supporting teachers and improving educators’ connections with their students’ families. Helping students who were homeless or otherwise challenged in their personal lives. Showing students who might not otherwise have considered going to college a path to higher education through Advanced Placement courses and other opportunities.</p><p>The same is, we may hope, true of a new way of teaching reading in the primary grades. It is called Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS, and<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/25/utah-wants-70-third-graders/\" target=\"_blank\"> it has shown remarkable progress</a> in a small pilot roll-out at Orem’s Westmore Elementary School.</p><p>Some of this stuff works. It needs to be watched, copied and funded.</p><p>Yet we approach the 2024 session of the Utah Legislature mostly in hopes that our proudly out-of-touch lawmakers just don’t make things worse for our schools.</p><p>It is up to all of us, not just parents and educators, to let our elected representatives know that shorting public education as a politically grandstanding move in support of some odd version of family values is not something we want, not something we will tolerate.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>For the foreseeable future, one fact remains undeniable. The vast majority of our children will come up through the public school system. It is therefore in everyone’s interest that such a system be as robust, as effective, as responsive, as creative as it can be.</p><p>This is true even for people who do not now have, never have had or never will have children in the public schools. We are all surrounded by, receiving services from, doing business with, hiring or being hired by, operated on, reading journalism produced by, protected and governed by public school graduates. They need to be the best.</p><p>And real education is not only embodied in the move to stress the STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and math — important as those subjects are.</p><p>Real education of necessity stresses history, civics, geography, media literacy, philosophy and the arts. Falling short in those areas is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2024/01/01/opinion-social-political-problems/\" target=\"_blank\">a major cause of division and manipulation in our society</a>, a clear threat to the future of our civilization.</p><p>As former Utah <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-utah-gary-herbert-speech.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. Gary Herbert was fond of saying</a>, when it comes to public education, it’s not all about the money. But it is some about the money. Public education is where our resources must be focused.</p><p>It goes far beyond the pointless and distracting focus some in our political class put on <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/11/15/banning-books-utah-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">imagined stacks of pornography</a> in our school libraries or <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/10/04/parents-criticize-completely/\" target=\"_blank\">fantasied waves of transgender students</a> kicking down locker room doors.</p><p>Beware, also, of activists and politicians who <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/11/fear-culture-wars-fuel-move-repeal/\" target=\"_blank\">pick fights over diversity</a>, at the K-12 and university level, as another distraction from the real mission of education.</p><p>Diversity in our schools is not a theory or a warped dream. It is a fact.</p><p>Our schools are responsible for educating everyone, including ever-increasing numbers of students from families that have little formal education in their backgrounds and can’t begin to prepare their children for a rigorous schooling experience. Who are homeless. Who don’t speak English.</p><p>(One <a href=\"https://www.lingualinx.com/case-studies/salt-lake-city-public-schools\" target=\"_blank\">survey indicates</a> there are more than 100 different languages spoken by students in the Salt Lake City School District alone.)</p><p>The agricultural/industrial era of leaving school in the eighth grade and making a good living is over. The days of Utah as a land of uniformity, where the schools could “Stack ‘em deep and teach ‘em cheap” are gone for good.</p><p>We must guard against the deliberate undermining of our public education system as some lawmakers look for more ways to divert revenue from the state income tax, once devoted by the state Constitution to education and education alone, to other uses.</p><p>And as legislators and other activists push to expand a taxpayer-funded voucher system for private and home schooling. A system that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/07/26/misleading-website-invites-utahns/\" target=\"_blank\">hasn’t even enrolled its first student</a> yet.</p><p>The Utah Fits All Scholarship, created and endowed with $42.5 million by the Legislature in its 2023 session, ponies up enough to offer $8,000 to each of 5,000 students whose families are seeking alternatives to public and charter schools. And to have the taxpayer share in the cost, even as the state has no way to look to see if the schooling provided is worth the cost.</p><p>This is a lack of oversight no lawmaker should or would tolerate for public schools or other public agencies. Yet, for this side hustle, a lack of accountability is not a bug, it’s a feature.</p><p>As others have pointed out, it sounds far too much like offering state money to families that are already relatively affluent so they can send their children to elite country clubs and athletic facilities because public parks and rec centers just aren’t good enough for them.</p><p>This semester, er, legislative session begins Jan. 16. <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Be aware</a>.

It would then be up to the district to determine if the instructional material constitutes a violation of state laws regarding pornography. Districts must consider if the material has “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” which requires an incredibly subjective evaluation that school districts have disagreed on as recently as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/10/23/we-looked-banned-books-utahs/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>. If HB 29 passes, it would only take three school districts banning a book or other instructional material to require districts across the state to yank it from the shelves, even if their school community disagrees with that subjective evaluation of its literary (or other) value.</p><p>This is just one of many upcoming bills designed to convince our community that teachers are untrustworthy and secretive, and that public schools are on a mission to indoctrinate students and ruin our state. The truth is, our schools are more accountable, transparent and accessible than they have ever been. The <a href=\"https://www.schools.utah.gov/administrativerules\" target=\"_blank\">state school board</a> and our local school boards establish detailed policies to ensure safety, accountability and fairness in our classrooms and have discipline or corrective procedures for if schools or teachers fall short. Every school has a <a href=\"https://www.utahpta.org/school-community-councils\" target=\"_blank\">School Community Council </a>of parents who have a direct vote on decisions the school makes. Teachers use content-specific and <a href=\"https://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/utahcorestandards\" target=\"_blank\">state board-approved core standards</a> to guide their instruction and selection of curriculum so it’s easy to search for what big ideas or skills students will be expected to learn. They often post assignments, readings and slides online for students (or parents) to access on platforms such as Canvas. Parents can also closely follow their student’s attendance, assignments and grades using online student information systems such as Power School or Skyward.</p><p>When the legislative session rolls around, if you see a bill that purports to improve our education system by regulating or micromanaging the daily work of teachers, making our schools more “transparent,” or removing materials that experienced, professional teachers and librarians have selected in alignment with school values and state standards, ask the teachers in your community how they feel about it. It is likely that the bills will be designed to solve a problem that doesn’t exist and will create significantly more work, stress, and unnecessary red tape for teachers and schools. Then, speak up as a parent and say these bills are not what our state needs.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>If you have a question or concern about something your child is learning, you can email the teacher and ask about it.

Western water managers aren’t keen to pursue either of those options.</p><p>“The Colorado River Basin has come together over the past year to create a consensus path to stabilize the system in the short term that now allows us to focus on the future,” Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said in a statement to The Tribune. “The Bureau of Reclamation is working with all partners across the Basin on what the operations of this critical system will look like Post 2026.”</p><p>Reclamation will consider the states’ timely proposal as one of several options for managing the Colorado River in future decades as they undertake the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) steps for post-2026 operations.</p><p>Haas said that she is optimistic about the states having a plan ready in time, despite the arduous months of negotiations ahead.</p><p>“If we want to control our destiny, if we want to have a stake in this, then we’ve got to put an alternative forth to be considered and evaluated,” Haas added.</p><p>When it comes to devising a plan to manage a river that sustains 40 million people, 30 tribes and many delicate ecosystems, there’s a lot to consider.</p><p>Serving as a disillusioning backdrop for negotiations is the fact that the Colorado River’s flows, which fill Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have decreased by 20% since the turn of the century. In the coming decades, water managers have to take the West’s hotter and drier climate into account.</p><p>“We’ve got to plan for the variability of hydrology, especially given climate change,” Haas said. “We have to have the tools and the flexibility to operate under a range of conditions. That’s the bottom line.”</p><p>Haas said that water negotiators are also considering<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/04/how-last-years-winter-continues/\" target=\"_blank\"> this winter’s lack of precipitation</a> in their discussions about the future.</p><p>The Upper Basin states (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) will also have to work with the states of the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada) to decide how to divide the river’s water — and how to conserve it. The Lower Basin states have already promised to cut their water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2023/12/15/californias-colorado-river-water/\" target=\"_blank\">part of a separate agreement</a> independent of post-2026 negotiations.</p><p>Negotiators must also consider the water rights of the federally recognized Native American tribes that call the Colorado River Basin home. To do so, the Department of the Interior invited all 30 tribes and the seven states to participate in a <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/news-release/4603\" target=\"_blank\">Federal-Tribal-State partnership, the first of its kind</a>.</p><p>“We developed the first-ever Federal-Tribal-State partnership group to promote equitable information-sharing and inclusive discussions among the Tribal Nations and States in the Colorado River Basin and have had several meetings since its inception last summer,” Touton said. “As the range of alternatives for operations post-2026 are developed, Reclamation is committed to an inclusive and transparent process with all our partners and the public.”</p><p>Even if the Colorado River Basin states get their plan to Reclamation in time, that doesn’t guarantee that federal officials will approve their plan. Reclamation could accept their plan wholesale, but the agency can also pick and choose different parts of the plan to approve at their discretion to develop different alternatives for post-2026 operations.</p><p>Reclamation wants to start modeling potential alternatives in April, Haas said, to publish a draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 operations by the end of 2024.</p><p><i><b>Editor’s note 2:39 pm Jan. 8, 2024: </b></i><i>This article was updated with comments from the Bureau of Reclamation about collaboration and tribal input in the negotiations.</i></p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n\\n</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'The question Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla says he struggled with during his interview with the Utah Jazz',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'The question Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla says he struggled with during his interview with the Utah Jazz'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Eric Walden'}],\n   'author': 'Eric Walden',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Eric Walden'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 23:14:29 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=23, tm_min=14, tm_sec=29, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Ahead of Friday’s Jazz-Celtics game, colleagues-turned-counterparts Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla discussed their once-competing bids to get Utah's head coaching job, and how their respective answers to one particular question may have proved a sliding-door moment.\",\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': \"Ahead of Friday’s Jazz-Celtics game, colleagues-turned-counterparts Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla discussed their once-competing bids to get Utah's head coaching job, and how their respective answers to one particular question may have proved a sliding-door moment.\"},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><b>Boston</b> • Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla spent the 2021-22 season as coworkers, both highly regarded assistant coaches on Ime Udoka’s Boston Celtics staff.</p><p>So highly regarded that, at the end of that season, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2022/06/28/utah-jazz-select-will-hardy/\" target=\"_blank\">both men were finalists</a> to replace Quin Snyder as head coach of the Utah Jazz.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2022/07/05/new-utah-jazz-coach-will-hardy/\" target=\"_blank\">We know how that turned out</a>.</p><p>Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/05/utah-jazzs-brutal-stretch-begins/\" target=\"_blank\">Friday’s game at TD Garden between the Jazz and Celtics</a>, Mazzulla — who would wind up getting Boston’s top job months after not landing Utah’s — was asked what he learned from the experience of interviewing with the Jazz.</p><p>“Never wear a suit ever again,” he quipped. “I wore a suit, and I was the most uncomfortable. I’m really pissed that I did that.”</p><p>More seriously, he reflected upon how one response he gave to Utah’s decision-makers perhaps proved a sliding-door moment.</p><p>“I kind of felt like in that interview, they asked me a particular question that I wasn’t quite ready to answer,” Mazzulla said. “It was like, ‘Do you think, at a young age, you can run an organization?’ And I knew I could, but I didn’t give off the answer that I needed to give to get the job.”</p><p>(Those two are currently the youngest head coaches in the NBA, with Hardy turning 36 years old in just over two weeks, and Mazzulla following suit in five more months.)</p><p>Mazzulla was subsequently asked if the Jazz had told him they found his answer lacking or if it was just something he intuited.</p><p>“I just felt that. I could just feel,” he said. “Not that they were wrong in that, by the way. They made the right choice in hiring Will, I want to be clear on that.”</p><p><i>So you’re not as good a coach as Will?</i> a reporter jokingly asked.</p><p>“No,” Mazzulla replied earnestly.</p><p>Just days before their 2022 training camp, the Celtics suspended Udoka for at least the 2022-23 season for violations of the team’s code of conduct.</p><p>When Mazzulla got an interview for what was then an interim promotion, he found his prior experience with the Jazz helpful this time around.</p><p>“Going through that process helped me articulate <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4324351/2023/03/19/danny-ainge-joe-mazzulla-jazz-celtics/\" target=\"_blank\">my strengths and what I think I can do</a>,” he said. “That was a good process to have to go through.”</p><p>After Mazzulla finished his pregame media session Friday, Hardy was asked how he handled that same query in his interview with the Jazz.</p><p>“I don’t know how that specific answer went — I didn’t get a report card after,” he replied dryly. “But I just tried to be as honest as possible, like, ‘I don’t have all the answers right now.’ I think when you’re young as a coach going into those interviews, there’s no reason to hide from those facts: Yes, I am young; yes, I’ve never been a head coach, but I think sometimes there’s strength in that. I’m not a finished product, I’m not rigid, I’m not walking in with a giant notebook that’s like, ‘Here’s my program, take it or leave it.’ I still don’t think I have all the answers.”</p><p>He would add that, as a mid-30s person now in his second year of his first-ever head coaching job, there’s still very much an acclimation process going on.</p><p>But he also feels like that’s a good thing.</p><p>“Leading an organization is hard, being in this seat is different than being an assistant in a thousand ways,” Hardy said. “You feel everything that happens, good or bad, in a very different way than when you’re an assistant. You feel a responsibility for not only the players, but you feel a responsibility for the people that you’ve hired and work with you every day.</p><p>“It’s something I’m still getting used to. I kind of hope I never fully get used to it,” he continued. “I think some of that anxiety or stress keeps you sharp — or it keeps <i>me</i> sharp. I do OK with some of that; you obviously don’t want to overload it, but it keeps me in the moment and keeps me on the next thing.”</p><p>The reflection bit over with, he naturally had to revert to sarcasm at the end.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll go back and ask [CEO Danny Ainge] what he thought of my answer,” Hardy said. “It’ll give us something to talk about.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'The best cocktail in Salt Lake?

There’s so much more to see and more people to meet.”</p><p>It’s safe to say that’s no problem after her year-long adventure.</p><p>That’s because Vallarta — whose day job is hosting the <a href=\"https://saltlake.citycast.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">City Cast Salt Lake podcast</a> — decided at the beginning of 2023 that she was going to do something a little crazy: grab a drink at every bar in Salt Lake County.</p><p>She drank at 211 bars in all.</p><p>The tour would be a bit of a logistical challenge. Sure, bars near her downtown Salt Lake City apartment would be relatively easy to pick off. But watering holes farther away required friendly designated drivers, geographic travel optimization, and, well, a lot of drinking.</p><p>Here’s a map of Vallarta’s 2023 journey. Dots on the map pop up to represent when in the year Vallarta visited each bar around the county.</p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p>She started out slowly, with those bars closer to her home. She didn’t hit the 50-bar mark until the end of April, but a late flourish of 83 bars visited in October, November and December ensured success before the year′s last call.</p><p>As Salt Lake’s foremost bar tourist, what can Vallarta teach us from her travels? Here’s what she said about her experiences — and Utah’s bar scene as a whole.</p><p>What makes a good bar?</p><p>Disappointingly, Vallarta declined to answer my obvious question.</p><p>“What’s the best bar in Salt Lake?”</p><p>She didn’t rank all 211 bars, which does feel understandable, and didn’t want to get into the cutthroat world of comparing these small businesses. <a href=\"https://saltlake.citycast.fm/best/the-best-salt-lake-bars-for-every-occasion\" target=\"_blank\">She has favorites for different occasions</a>: a first date (Junior’s), an anniversary (Bar Nohm or Sayonara), or a night at a dive (Bongo or Club 48).</p><p>But Vallarta said that there was clear continuity in her favorite bars, different types though they may be:</p><p>“A great bar is so clear in its identity, that when you walk in, you know what’s expected of you,” she said. “How to behave, and what is being offered, and what is not being offered. A bad bar is a bar without a clear identity.”</p><p>And most of all, through her conversations with people around the valley, she found another commonality:</p><p>“A key takeaway from this journey is that the best bar is the one closest to you,” she said.</p><p>Do the bars feel safe?</p><p>Another question that Vallarta said she heard frequently: “Did you ever feel unsafe during your quest?”</p><p>She said she didn’t — that “not once” did she feel either unsafe or even unwelcomed at the bar she was at. She acknowledges that her project’s usual modus operandi, popping into a bar for a drink or two, might have led to different feelings than for someone who stayed longer. Bad things do sometimes happen at bars.</p><img alt=\"(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.\" height=\"4032\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/OKk7979wFMWrya3jmMKBixQJC_I=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/PY7K4R3KNBCT5B4P4YRG2GR4PU.jpg\" width=\"3024\" /><br /><caption>(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.</caption><p>But in general, she felt that some bars just got a bad rap from people who didn’t know better.</p><p>“I think the implication of that question is — were these places seedy?” Vallarta said. “I went to a lot of dive bars, and I didn’t really meet seedy people, I met people who just think that the best bar is the one closest to their house.”</p><p>Bar staff deserved a lot of credit, too.</p><p>“I would attribute never feeling unsafe to how lucky we are to have really great bartenders and bouncers in Salt Lake County. I’m not just talking about your favorite door guy you know,” Vallarta said. “I’m talking about — when I went to the Second Amendment-themed bar in Herriman ... they could not have been more welcoming.”</p><p>What’s the best drink in Salt Lake County?</p><p>OK, Vallarta couldn’t try every drink in the county — nor did she really try to. But especially at Salt Lake County’s cocktail bars, she asked bartenders to recommend the best drinks they had available.</p><p>And one stood out: Seabird’s “Nine Post Cards” cocktail. At locations in Draper and the Gateway in Salt Lake City, Seabird’s bartenders make the drink with Suntory’s Haku vodka, pear liqueur, sesame miso syrup, and lemon juice. The cocktail costs a pricey $14. Still, she says it was worth it.</p><p>“It was divine,” Vallarta says. “It’s hard to say because sometimes you taste something delicious, and it’s also about the moment, what you ate an hour before, what you’re in the mood for. But this was just a good a-- drink.”</p><p>Notable bar crawls</p><p>In order to accomplish her goal, Vallarta organized many of her bar trips into weekend bar crawls, in which she’d visit establishments in a particular location or with a particular theme. These days became some of the highlights of the year.</p><p>• First, she says, was her Fourth of July bar crawl in Magna, which featured five different establishments.</p><p>“The Fourth of July in Magna is tremendous,” Vallarta said. “There’s a bustle about it. There’s a chaos about it. ... People are just down to clown. When you’re in Magna, you’re almost like ‘Are we in Nevada?’”</p><img alt=\"(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.\" height=\"2932\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/_CwqDhkNekodOHbvvujjDLOQwvs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/VOD4UUDTZJGU5PUPN66EWZOUF4.jpg\" width=\"3022\" /><br /><caption>(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.</caption><p>• Another notable trip: the Saturday she visited all nine ‘Bout Time Pub &amp; Grub establishments in the county. A large group of friends and even just curious acquaintances joined the shenanigans. The chain is by far the most ubiquitous bar in the valley. Vallarta says that the ‘Bout Time location in West Valley City near the Maverik Center is the best one of the bunch.</p><p>• She organized two crawls in which she visited bars that aren’t open to the general public — those at country clubs and those for veterans. Sometimes, those clubs opened their doors when Vallarta explained her resolution, at others, she found a club member who “sponsored” her for a day.</p><p>The impact of Utah’s liquor laws</p><p>One of Vallarta’s most interesting takeaways was how Utah’s liquor laws impacted bars’ successes or failures.</p><p>First, Vallarta noted a relative lack of neighborhood bars. Because state regulations prohibit bars from being near churches, schools, libraries, parks, and playgrounds, they tend to be pushed to unusual places, or bigger retail developments — ironically, farther away from where people are likely to live. As a result, not many people can walk to a neighborhood bar outside of downtown Salt Lake City.</p><p>But Utah’s strict limit on the number of bar licenses available — one for every 10,200 residents — also had an impact on the character of new bars that open, Vallarta believes.</p><p>In short, the DABS only gives licenses to bars that are ready to open immediately. As a result, new bar owners must pay rent, develop a space, hire staff, and have supplies ready for months before opening a bar — a huge initial expense. But bar owners can’t really advertise about a new bar opening, either, because there’s no known opening date.</p><p>“You definitely notice a difference between places that are long established and places that are new,” Vallarta said. “It almost feels like you need to have some sort of like a gimmick or a very specific identity — like you’re trying to become the talk of the town. You’re trying to generate more enthusiasm than I think is appropriate for any new business to have to generate while opening their doors and training.”</p><p>But while the bars themselves differ, Vallarta says there’s value to any bar in Utah.</p><p>“Especially in Utah, being a place where people can gather (is important),” Vallarta said. “It’s a third space, where people can gather and where it’s not unacceptable or rude or bothersome to strike up a conversation with a stranger. There’s a little bit of identity politics at play when you’re in a bar in the state, because right away, people start to make inferences about your lifestyle.”</p><p>It’s true — bargoers are a little rarer around here. But perhaps there’s a lesson there: the inside of every bar, no matter the zip code, has its own community, and perhaps those communities have more in common than you might anticipate.</p><p>Take it from someone who’s been to all of them.</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

Spencer Cox’s December news conference and his comments about the proliferation and apparent ineffectiveness of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies. However, the two articles published on the subject (<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">the first on Dec. 20</a>, the second on <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/21/gov-cox-shares-no-evidence-that/\" target=\"_blank\">Dec. 21</a>) fail to capture the reality of DEI implementation and its impact on higher education.</p><p>While the articles are informative, their underlying purpose seems to be to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the governor’s concerns. As someone who has taught at the university level for more than two decades, and who has watched in dismay as the zero-sum, DEI mindset has infiltrated higher education, Cox’s concerns are not only legitimate, they are commendable.</p><p>Nothing is more crucial to the perpetuation of a bad idea than the misrepresentation of anything or anyone who disagrees with it. Take, for instance, the first sentence of the article “<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">Bordering on Evil”: Diversity hiring practices at Utah’s universities will end in 2024, Cox says</a>: “Gov. Spencer Cox attacked diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs at Utah’s colleges and universities, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/13/very-political-diversity-efforts/\" target=\"_blank\">repeating his assertion that such initiatives foster divisiveness</a> instead of inclusivity, during his monthly news conference Wednesday.”</p><p>With a lede and first sentence like this, readers might reasonably wonder how exactly Cox “attacked” DEI. Unfortunately, neither article answers this question, so I watched the news conference. Far from what the article would have me believe, I found Cox’s discussion of DEI to be both measured and honest as well as contrary to the prevailing DEI orthodoxy. Thus, according to the interpretation offered by the article, to disagree with DEI is to “attack” it.</p><p>This dangerous conflation is known as “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716590/\" target=\"_blank\">concept creep</a>,” which, according to professor of psychology Nick Haslam, who coined the term in 2016, “is the process by which harm-related topics experience semantic expansion to include topics which would not have originally been envisaged to be included under that label.”</p><p>Put simply, where once we could agree on the meaning of words, concept creep has expanded the meaning of words such as trauma, harm and racist to the point of meaninglessness. Add to this the similarly destructive idea that words are violence and the prospect of having much needed, difficult conversations is essentially reduced to nil.</p><p>On the off chance these conversations do take place, in my experience, they are often undermined by power dynamics between participants and characterized by confusion, particularly when it comes to the meaning of DEI-related terms. In fact, I would argue that when it comes to DEI, confusion is a feature, not a bug.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>I therefore think that Cox can be forgiven for what appears to be some confusion of his own, namely, that university employees are required to sign diversity statements as a condition of employment. Although diversity statements <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-universitys-new-loyalty-oath-11576799749\" target=\"_blank\">have indeed been used</a> by universities <a href=\"https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2019/12/31/life-science-jobs-at-berkeley-with-hiring-giving-precedence-to-diversity-and-inclusion-statements/\" target=\"_blank\">to filter applicants</a> on the basis of race and gender, I don’t think there is any evidence that the Utah university system requires prospective employees to sign a diversity statement.</p><p>But as even the most cursory examination of the job boards for any of the state’s institutions of higher education will show, diversity statements are in fact a regular part of employee applications.</p><p>One might reasonably ask, then, what is the difference between being required to sign a diversity statement and requiring applicants to submit one as part of an application for employment? Perhaps that is a Tribune article for another day. Also for another day might be a follow up article investigating Cox’s concern that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">DEI programs are bloated and ineffective</a>.</p><p>Whether from the point of view of university members, tax payers, state legislators or the Utah Board of Higher Education, these are valid questions and as someone who, like university professors themselves, is obligated to represent everyone he serves, Cox is right to ask them.</p><p>My own concern, however, is that making inquiries such as these is, in the eyes of some, tantamount to aiding and abetting. Consequently, those best positioned to inform the public may lack the will to do so for fear of being ostracized or worse, or because they too believe that the current trajectory is the only way forward, regardless of all the good, the right and the true they will have to sacrifice along the way.</p><p>I say this not to disparage the many well-intentioned people who, like me, are trying to make our universities better for everyone (the what), but rather to elucidate some of the very real obstacles to doing precisely that (the how).</p><p>The willful misrepresentation of reality is nothing new, but given the purported goals of DEI and the fact that everyone has a stake in realizing them, we all have a responsibility to privilege the truth, however elusive, difficult or unpopular it may be.</p><img alt=\"Maximilian Werner\" height=\"2316\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/R2pKXCE9kj5BEIbht5M_MDImKwo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/SASCF7GJ2RHO3POQHET6K5U3UE.jpg\" width=\"2276\" /><br /><caption>Maximilian Werner</caption><p><b>Maximilian Werner</b><i> used to be a Democrat, but now he is politically unhoused and, given the way things are going, expects to remain that way for the foreseeable future.</i></p><p><i>The Salt Lake Tribune is committed to creating a space where Utahns can share ideas, perspectives and solutions that move our state forward.

Now an outside group is wading into conservative-leaning Utah to recruit Democrats to follow Smith’s lead and jump into races where Republican names were the only ones on the ballot.</p><p>Contesting every race</p><p>Contest Every Race is a project by Movement Labs, an incubator for progressive organizing. It launched a grant program in 2021 to add more Democrats to ballots across the country, with an early focus in purple and deep red states, and <a href=\"https://www.contesteveryrace.com/about/mission\" target=\"_blank\">ambitious plans</a> to help the party contest every electoral competition in the U.S. by 2028.</p><p>This fall, the nonprofit partnered with the Utah Democratic Party to ping phones in all 29 counties, urging people to run in legislative and other down-ballot races.

(Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>In addition to uncontested legislative races, Democrats have their eye on smaller races throughout the state with aims to build a pipeline of future candidates for larger posts.</p><p>“It’s not likely that an everyday working mom or young person that recently turned 18 is going to file for statewide office out of a text, but they might run for their local school board or their local city council,” Jubelirer said. “And we’ve seen that happen, and then those people are developing their leadership skills, getting governing experience, policy experience, and this is really our way of building the bench of potential folks who could run for statewide office.”</p><p>To recruit candidates who are new to politics, Jubelirer added, Democrats need to have local infrastructure in place to support them. So the initiative is also offering $2,000 in grants annually to county parties that are willing to complete monthly goals, like hosting outreach events and tabling at community celebrations.</p><p>All of Utah’s 29 counties have a Democratic party, according to the state party’s website. But at least two of the most rural counties don’t have any leadership listed. Many of Utah’s county Democratic parties <a href=\"https://disclosures.utah.gov/Search/PublicSearch?type=PARTY\" target=\"_blank\">have not reported financial contributions</a> to the state in over a decade.</p><p>Jubelirer said county parties have long been under-invested in by state parties and the Democratic National Committee. While he acknowledged that $2,000 is a small contribution when looked at through the lens of finances in national races, Jubelirer said some parties have been able to use it to rent office space or purchase phones for low-income volunteers.</p><p>‘Small d democratic process</p><p>A lack of Democratic candidates in state legislative races extends beyond Utah’s most remote counties. Republicans without opponents won numerous seats along the Wasatch Front and up and down the Interstate 15 corridor in 2022.</p><p>Approximately one-third of state legislative seats up for election last year were won by Republicans without opponents. An additional 13% of winning lawmakers were Republicans who only faced third-party challengers, meaning Democrats didn’t have a candidate in nearly half of state legislative races.</p><p>Two Democrats in blue Salt Lake County won House races uncontested last year.</p><p>A different set of Senate seats will be up for reelection in 2024 for the first time since <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/11/08/five-things-you-need-know/\" target=\"_blank\">new boundaries were drawn</a>. Approximately one-third of Senate seats not up for election in 2022 were held by Republicans who were previously uncontested, and nearly 60% of their races didn’t include Democrats.</p><p><i>[The story continues below these maps.]</i></p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p>The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature by 12 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate.

Spencer Cox’s rejection of a bill that would ban transgender students from playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity.</p><p>“It’s not really a ‘small d’ democratic process if people only have one option to vote for,” said Thom DeSirant, the executive director of the Utah Democratic Party. “You get your ballot and you just have one option — you can’t really exercise your right to vote unless you choose to just leave the option blank, which is not something we want people to do.”</p><p>“I think that just having these races contested also helps increase turnout in general,” he added. “People just see one option on the ballot, they feel like there’s no reason to even vote.”</p><p>Brigham Young University political science professor Adam Brown, who has <a href=\"https://adambrown.info/p/research/utah_legislature\" target=\"_blank\">compiled an in-depth guide</a> to the Utah Legislature, agrees that ideally, both parties would contest every race — from Republicans running in Salt Lake City’s Avenues neighborhood to Democrats competing in St. George.</p><p>But he isn’t sure that it would result in more Democrats getting elected, or whether it would even push Republicans fighting for reelection closer to the political center. The results of Contest Every Race’s efforts in Utah will likely vary district-by-district, Brown said, and would depend on how competitive the race is and how “much the incumbent believes that a loss is possible.”</p><p>“Every officeholder thinks to some extent about staying in office. In most of the state, there is so little competition that this concern only revolves around renomination,” Brown wrote in an email.</p><p>“An opponent in the general election with a real chance of winning would obviously force incumbents to more carefully balance their renomination constituency against their general election [constituency] — ... the issue that Republican and Democratic legislators in purplish places like Taylorsville, West Valley, and Sandy confront.”</p><p>In other states where Contest Every Race has recruited Democratic candidates, Jubelirer said about 38% of the approximately 5,500 political newcomers won their races. Another perk of recruiting more candidates to the ballot for Democrats, Jubelirer noted, is that it would likely increase the number of votes going toward Democratic congressional and presidential candidates.</p><img alt=\"(Zak Podmore | The Salt Lake Tribune) Davina Smith holds a campaign sign in Monument Valley at an event announcing she\\'ll be running for the Utah House of Representatives.

Phil Lyman, who has served in the Legislature since 2019, he secured fewer votes when she challenged him in 2022.

The congressman said he made up his mind after he heard from “people from all walks of life reaching out to ask what is it going to take to get me to reconsider.”</p><p>Some of that encouragement included a <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/11/09/utah-rep-john-curtis-reconsidering/\">political action committee called “Conservative Values for Utah”</a> spending $89,000 in November on a television ad nudging Curtis to reverse course.</p><p>If he becomes a senator, Curtis would like to continue work he’s done advocating for conservative solutions to climate problems, and told The Salt Lake Tribune he would like to dive into social media and artificial intelligence regulation.</p><p>Caroline Gleich</p><p>Professional ski mountaineer Caroline Gleich visited Washington before to advocate for environment-friendly policies. Now she wants to make a more permanent home there as Utah’s next U.S. senator.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2024/01/08/world-renowned-environmental/\" target=\"_blank\">Becoming one of two Democratic candidates</a> to run for Senate, the athlete and activist posts about her adventures — including summiting Mount Everest — along with climate concerns and human rights issues on her popular social media pages.</p><p>Gleich has previously spoken at rallies for policies to save the ailing Great Salt Lake and has organized a 1.9-mile “Run to Redistrict” through all four of Utah’s congressional districts to protest the electoral boundaries established by the Utah Legislature.</p><p>Her “vision for Utah,” a statement said, “is rooted in a commitment to creating positive change, with a focus on advocating for people and the planet, social and environmental justice, and elevating critical issues such as air quality, gender equity, climate action, and more.”</p><p>Brent O. Hatch</p><p>An attorney and former associate White House counsel to former President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2024/01/02/orrin-hatchs-son-is-running-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Brent Orrin Hatch announced on Jan. 2</a> that he was filing for a chance to claim his late father’s seat in the Senate.</p><p>Hatch is a treasurer for the conservative and libertarian-minded Federalist Society, an organization of lawyers that has been known to influence decisions in the highest political offices in the country.</p><p>“Government cannot continue like it has for the past several years. We must take the budget, inflation and securing our borders more seriously,” Hatch wrote in a news release. “We need to elect people who have had real jobs, had to make payrolls and are not wed to lobbyists and the political class – people who speak plainly and use common sense.”</p><p>Robert Newcomb</p><p>Running under the ultra-conservative Independent American Party, Newcomb writes in a pinned post on his X profile, “As the U.S. Senator from Utah, I will prevent federal orgs from disregarding/disrespecting our 1st Amendment through censorship &amp; social media manipulation. I will gladly defund/dismantle any federal org who tries.”</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.senatornewcomb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">biography on his website</a>, Newcomb is a Navy veteran and works as a civilian engineer at Hill Air Force Base.</p><p>Carolyn Phippen</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/11/01/carolyn-phippen-former-mike-lee/\" target=\"_blank\">Carolyn Phippen, a former staffer for Sen. Mike Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/07/01/utah-gop-primary-voters-pick/\" target=\"_blank\">lost a bid to unseat state Rep. Jeff Stenquist</a>, R-Draper, in 2022 and joined the Senate race in early November 2023.</p><p>Phippen, who was considered further to the right than the incumbent lawmaker, won GOP delegates’ support at last year’s convention before being defeated by her signature-gathering opponent in the general election.</p><p>“I’ve fought on the front lines of the conservative movement while raising a family,” Phippen said in a news release announcing her candidacy. “Now is the time to stand up for the principles that made our country great.”</p><p>She is the executive director of Freedom Front Utah, which aims to defend “free market principles for Utah businesses and employees.” Following the 2020 presidential election, Phippen went to Washington, D.C., to march in a “Stop the Steal” rally.</p><p>Josh Randall</p><p>Josh Randall, an accountant and an audit manager for the Utah State Institutional Trust Lands Administration, jumped into the race in early October.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61552181581569\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign Facebook page</a>, he wrote, “I’m running for U.S. Senate with a focus on strengthening families, encouraging everyone to live and vote their religious values, and shrinking the government to operate under a balanced budget.”</p><p>His website expands on that announcement, saying he stands for what he describes as “family values” — Randall supports abortion restrictions passed by the Utah Legislature, opposes gay marriage, and considers it “vital that our lawmakers understand that each of us is male or female.”</p><p>Trent Staggs</p><p>The day after he filed to run with the FEC in May, Riverton Mayor <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/05/23/this-utah-mayor-wants-unseat-sen/\" target=\"_blank\">Trent Staggs announced his candidacy on X</a>, taking a swipe at Romney.</p><p>“I’m not a career politician, or a Massachusetts millionaire,” Staggs said in a video. “I’m a mayor, a businessman, husband and father who wants his children to grow up with the same opportunities that I did. And I’m running for United States Senate to make sure that they do.”</p><p>In 2020, Staggs ran an unsuccessful, Romney-endorsed campaign for Salt Lake County mayor, losing to Democratic Mayor Jenny Wilson.</p><p>In September, failed Arizona 2022 gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake — and current U.S. Senate candidate — <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/09/16/conservative-star-kari-lake/\" target=\"_blank\">traveled to Utah to fundraise</a> for Staggs. And <a href=\"https://trentstaggs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on his website</a>, he says he is endorsed by conservative political commentators Mark Levin and Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Staggs lists “smaller government,” “safer families” and a “stronger economy” as his priorities.</p><p>Chandler Tanner</p><p>Republican Chandler Tanner is an attorney and co-founder of <a href=\"http://Bookroo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bookroo.com</a>, a company that sells book subscriptions for children.</p><p>Brad Wilson</p><p>Former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/04/13/house-speaker-brad-wilson-is/\" target=\"_blank\">announced he was exploring</a> a Senate bid last April, filing with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate that same day. And then, five days after Romney said he would retire, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/09/18/utah-house-speaker-brad-wilson/\" target=\"_blank\">released a statement</a> saying he would step down from the Legislature to pursue the Senate seat.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/09/27/brad-wilson-says-hell-be/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilson held a campaign launch party</a> in late September, where he told supporters, “If we don’t act in Washington, Joe Biden and radical leftists — as well as go-along-to-get-along Republicans — are taking us down dead-end streets. These dead-end streets are where schools are teaching our kids what to think instead of how to think, where government right now is handing out so much money that some people can live better lives with handouts than they can by going and earning a paycheck.”</p><p>An early August news release from Wilson’s exploratory committee boasted the support of several dozen “conservative Utah legislators,” saying they were endorsing and encouraging him to run. The former lawmaker, who’s made his fortune as a residential developer, has so far out-raised and out-spent his opponents while also loaning his campaign $1.8 million.</p><p>Others who have filed to run:</p><ul><li>Archie Williams III (Democrat)</li><li>Clark S.
