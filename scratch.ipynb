He averaged 7 points per game at BYU, scoring a <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2022/03/16/caleb-lohner-scores-byu/\" target=\"_blank\">career-high 20 points</a> with the Cougars in a National Invitation Tournament win over Long Beach State in March 2022.</p><p>Lohner, who comes off the bench for Baylor, is averaging 3.4 points and 2.9 rebounds while shooting 59.4% from the field and 40% from the 3-point line.</p><p>Lohner was asked Monday how he felt about facing his old team. Here is what he said.</p><p>On facing BYU</p><p>“You transfer from a school, you want to beat them. But they have a great program, a great team. Either way, selfishly, for me, it would be a great win. But also for the team, they’re a great basketball program. So any game in the Big 12 we can win is a good game.”</p><p>On his friends at BYU</p><p>“I still keep up with quite a few of the guys. A lot of the guys that I played with in the past and at BYU are great guys. My situation, [I] think I just needed to be at Baylor and that was it. But yeah, still great relationships over there.</p><p>On what he thinks of BYU as a team</p><p>“They shoot the ball really well. They cut, super active, especially when their big gets it at the top of the key. They run all these different motions and pin-downs and ball screens. Fast-paced team on offense. I think it’ll be important for us to talk through a lot of those switches and defensive schemes that we’re going to have going into the game. But they’re great basketball team, great basketball program. It’s going to be a good one.”</p><p>On defending BYU’s passing</p><p>“They have a great big who is really, really smart with the ball. Traditionally, I think a lot of we’ve played in the past, they’ve had more traditional rollers. So with them just being the assist team that they are, keeping your head on a swivel, making sure you’re not getting back cut, watching out for guys on the help side. Again, they’re a great passing team, a great 3-point shooting team. So it’s going to challenge us.”</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Bagley Cartoon: Man of La MAGA',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Bagley Cartoon: Man of La MAGA'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/bagley/2024/01/08/bagley-cartoon-man-la-maga/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/bagley/2024/01/08/bagley-cartoon-man-la-maga/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/bagley/2024/01/08/bagley-cartoon-man-la-maga/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Pat Bagley'}],\n   'author': 'Pat Bagley',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Pat Bagley'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 20:24:26 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=20, tm_min=24, tm_sec=26, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><br /></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'A new ‘frugal’ Republican is running to replace Rep.

Él cree que cuando las oficinas universitarias apoyan a poblaciones estudiantiles específicas, como los estudiantes latinos o negros, crean división y exclusión para otros.</p><p>“Necesitamos centrar los esfuerzos en las universidades en los estudiantes y en los individuos, en lugar de en los grupos”, afirmó. “Debe ser centrado y justo para todos”.</p><p>Dijo que ha oído que más estudiantes de color son estudiantes universitarios de primera generación que estudiantes blancos, lo cual es cierto. Pero en lugar de centrarse en los estudiantes de color, dijo, y excluir a los estudiantes blancos que también podrían ser los primeros en sus familias en asistir a la escuela, preferiría ver una oficina para todos los estudiantes de primera generación, lo que considera que hace que el acceso sea más fácil. amplio y disponible para todos en lugar de para unos pocos.</p><p>De manera similar, preferiría ver esfuerzos para apoyar a los estudiantes de familias que viven por debajo del nivel de pobreza que oficinas basadas en raza o etnia. Lo describió como “basarlo en una característica demográfica más que en el color de la piel de alguien”.</p><p>Johnson dijo que no quiere que se gaste dinero estatal “para ayudar a un grupo sobre otro simplemente por su pertenencia a un grupo”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/27/republican-lawmaker-pulls-his-too/\">El año pasado, Johnson dijo que cada año se gastan aproximadamente $11 millones en programas DEI en colegios y universidades de Utah</a>, una cifra que, según dijo, proviene de investigaciones legislativas. Eso lo financian los contribuyentes y él siente que existe la obligación de gastarlo de una manera que produzca resultados notables.</p><p>Cuando se le preguntó qué resultados necesitaría mostrar una oficina de DEI para ser considerada exitosa, Johnson no dio ejemplos específicos, sino que señaló que el gobernador también cuestiona qué métricas están alcanzando los programas.</p><p>“Hay un papel claro de la educación y de hacer que las personas sean mejores ciudadanos y ciudadanos más productivos”, dijo Johnson. “Y si no obtenemos retorno de esa inversión, tenemos que preguntarnos, ¿por qué hacemos esto? ¿Qué obtendremos a cambio?</p><p>Dijo que parte de su impulso también proviene del reciente fallo de la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos de prohibir la acción afirmativa (destinada a abrir oportunidades para personas de minorías y entornos subrepresentados) con aceptaciones universitarias. Le gustaría que las universidades, en general, dejaran de centrarse en la raza.</p><p>Él siente que, con esos esfuerzos, la educación superior se ha alejado de su misión de educar a los estudiantes y ha comenzado a tener un sesgo contra los conservadores que asisten o trabajan allí.

Se tomó un descanso, fundó una empresa de software y luego regresó como profesor en la Universidad Estatal de Utah. Mientras tanto, dijo: “Habiendo estado dentro de ese sistema y visto lo que está sucediendo, es más difícil para un conservador dentro del sistema que cuando yo comencé”.</p><p>Dijo que apoya la reciente iniciativa del Sistema de Educación Superior de Utah que exige que <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/02/gov-cox-doesnt-want-utah-colleges/\">el liderazgo de las universidades públicas del estado sea neutral en cuestiones políticas. </a>También impone limitaciones al discurso de los estudiantes, incluido el hecho de que un grupo no puede gritar a otro, incluso si no están de acuerdo sobre un tema o sienten que es un discurso de odio.</p><p>Esto se produjo después de que se retirara <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/11/17/university-utah-withdrew-its/\">el patrocinio de un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad de Utah, MECHA,</a> después de que la escuela dijera que interrumpió el evento de un club conservador que criticaba a la comunidad transgénero.</p><p>Johnson dijo que quiere que las universidades adopten y apoyen la “diversidad de puntos de vista” en el futuro.</p><p>Otro legislador analiza las “pruebas de fuego” universitarias</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/HALLK/\">La representante Katy Hall, republicana por South Ogden</a>, también presentó en la última sesión un proyecto de ley sobre DEI que busca revivir.</p><p>Su intento anterior buscaba prohibir que las escuelas, tanto las públicas como las escuelas K-12, preguntaran a un solicitante cualquier cosa sobre su trabajo para promover la inclusión y la diversidad. Pasó por la Cámara, pero quedó retenido en un comité del Senado.</p><p>La idea estaba en línea con lo que Cox había apuntado recientemente en sus declaraciones.</p><p>Hall no respondió a varias solicitudes para hablar con The Tribune para esta historia, pero un portavoz de la Casa de Utah envió un comunicado suyo.</p><p>En eso, Hall dijo que está “preocupada por los innumerables ejemplos de pruebas de fuego requeridas por las instituciones de educación superior de Utah” al contratar profesores y personal. Eso es lo que dijo que pretende abordar con su propuesta en esta sesión.</p><p>Dijo que ha estado trabajando con “legisladores, el poder ejecutivo, profesores y partes interesadas de la educación superior para comprender mejor los requisitos de la DEI y encontrar un camino a seguir que cree igualdad de oportunidades para todos”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/5/24026683/utah-lawmaker-points-to-university-of-utah-job-postings-in-push-against-diversity-statements\">Hall le dijo recientemente a KSL</a> que le preocupa cuántas ofertas de trabajo para los colegios y universidades públicas del estado requieren que los solicitantes proporcionen un comentario sobre sus creencias en materia de diversidad. Estimó que entre el 15% y el 20% de las solicitudes de la Universidad de Utah incluían eso.</p><p>Un representante examina a todos los empleadores y las creencias de DEI</p><p>Un tercer proyecto de ley para esta sesión analiza la DEI, pero si bien incluye universidades públicas, no se limita solo a ellas.</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/JIMENT/\">El representante Tim Jimenez, republicano por Tooele</a>, quiere asegurarse de que todos los empleadores del estado, tanto públicos como privados, no tengan ningún tipo de requisito para que un empleado firme un documento o marque una casilla prometiendo aceptar cualquier creencia sobre diversidad o inclusión.</p><p>Dijo que los empleadores tienen el derecho de la Primera Enmienda a decir lo que representa su empresa. Pero, añadió, los empleados tienen el mismo derecho a no ser obligados a aceptar algo en lo que no creen.</p><p>Jimenez dijo que escuchó a empleados estatales que expresaron su preocupación por esto, lo que lo impulsó a investigar el tema.</p><p>Lo ve como una continuación de sus esfuerzos de la última sesión, <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0427.html\">con el HB427</a>, centrado en lo que él llama “libertad individual” en la educación. Ese proyecto de ley fue aprobado y promulgado y ahora prohíbe que las escuelas K-12 enseñen a los estudiantes que son responsables de cualquier racismo, sexismo u otra discriminación en el pasado.</p><p>Ese proyecto de ley fue una <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/05/19/protest-over-critical/\">consecuencia del esfuerzo anterior de la Legislatura para prohibir en las escuelas K-12 cualquier discusión sobre la teoría crítica de la raza</a>, un marco académico de nivel universitario que postula que las instituciones del país se formaron a partir de principios racistas. No hay evidencia de que se estuviera enseñando ampliamente aquí.</p><p>Jimenez dijo que su nuevo proyecto de ley ahora toma la misma idea y la traslada al lugar de trabajo.</p><img alt=\"(Foto cortesía) En la foto aparece el representante Tim Jimenez.\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/Snx61VzfR0hqX_tgCOyy5nxAlv4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/WWMIAESAVBAD7CFIXCRQMAD54Q.tif\" /><br /><caption>(Foto cortesía) En la foto aparece el representante Tim Jimenez.</caption><p>Dijo que aún no ha descubierto todos los mecanismos, incluidas las limitaciones que el Estado podría imponer a los empleadores privados.</p><p>“Esa es el área en la que estamos trabajando para que todo esté bien en el idioma”, dijo. “Queremos que la gente tenga trabajo.

Much of the planning and programs are handled regionally by <a href=\"https://www.uasd.org/district-listing/category/water-conservancy-districts-2\" target=\"_blank\">15 water conservancy districts</a> that offer incentives for voluntary conservation measures through individual cities.

I didn’t even text,” she said. “I didn’t even look at my phone” while watching the episode.</p><p>Asked if she thinks the “RHOSLC” cast members deserve an Oscar for their performance, Lawrence replied, “I’ll give ‘em mine! I don’t care. They deserve it!”</p><p>(Neither Keltin nor Lawrence acknowledged that Osars are for acting, and the Housewives are supposedly not acting — they’re appearing in a “reality” show.)</p><p>In that season finale, cast members Heather Gay, Lisa Barlow, Meredith Marks, Whitney Rose and Angie Katsanevas <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2023/12/10/scott-d-pierce-among-millionaire/\" target=\"_blank\">confronted Monica Garcia</a> —\\xa0who joined the cast in Season 4 — after Heather learned that Monica is behind the infamous Reality Von Tease Instagram account, which has trolled the Housewives viciously for years.

She did, however, insist she only posted about <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2023/01/19/victims-real-housewife-slc-jen/\" target=\"_blank\">former cast member Jen Shah</a>, who’s now serving a prison term after confessing to federal fraud charges —\\xa0although the other women did not believe her.</p><p>While being interviewed on the Golden Globes red carpet by Nischelle Turner of “Entertainment Tonight,” Lawrence gave a “shoutout to the best finale I have ever seen on reality TV. Oh my God! Wow.” She even repeated (to the best of her memory) Heather’s performance in the show, which she called “amazing.” </p><p>Lawrence is a fan of multiple iterations of “The Real Housewives. Although that was her favorite season finale, “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” is not her favorite show. “I’m alway partial to Beverly Hills,” Lawrence said. “I’m relieved by the [overhauled] New York crew. ... I think they’re going to round out nicely. Everybody seems to have the right personality disorder that we like to see.</p><p>“I really liked ‘Dallas,’ but nobody else did.” (It was canceled in 2021.)</p><p>She didn’t watch the “RHOSLC” season finale until “a couple days later,” and she was “stone cold sober, because I was starving for this event, and I was jaw dropped.” She effused over the show and the women on it.</p><p>“I want a painting of the moment where they’re all on the beach” as Heather tells Lisa, Meredith and Whitney about Monica’s betrayal. “The different looks (on their faces,” Lawrence said on E!. “It was amazing. And they were like a little band of witches. You know, like, they all fight and they came together for this amazing moment.”</p><p>The three-part Season 4 reunion begins Tuesday on Bravo — 6 p.m. on Dish and Directive; 9 p.m. on Comcast.

These studies reinforce what we instinctively feel when we take hikes in our foothills, harvest apples from our backyard trees, or take a stroll under the tall trees of Liberty Park.</p><p>Utah is a symphony of organizations that aims to increase respectful access to nature in our state. Each instrument in this orchestra offers a unique sound to enrich the quality of our lives and our environment.</p><p>But unlike a real symphony, there is no single conductor who keeps track of which instruments are represented and the pace of the music. Lack of coordination risks potential redundancy or imbalance of efforts, which may lead to territoriality and competition for limited resources among groups working toward the same mission. To avoid that, novice groups must learn about the actions of others and ensure their contribution is distinct.</p><p>One such newcomer is <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nature and Human Health-Utah (NHH-UT)</a>, a research/practice collaborative supported by <a href=\"https://www.reifund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the REI Cooperative Action Fund</a>. NHH-UT was founded in 2019 by Nalini Nadkarni, forest ecologist and Professor Emerita at the University of Utah. Our group is co-lead by Tim Brown, CEO of the Tracy Aviary, and Dart Schmalz, Department Chair of Parks, Recreation and Tourism at the University.</p><p>We founded NHH-UT because we recognized the increasing societal shifts to lifestyles in nature-deficient environments, which has <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/6/585/294707\" target=\"_blank\">negative impacts</a> on both human and environmental health. Although <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28796634/\" target=\"_blank\">recent research documents</a> significant health benefits of nature engagement, there is limited awareness in the traditional healthcare enterprise and the public.</p><p>Because of this limited awareness, NHH-UT’s mission is to understand, articulate and foster relationships between nature and human health by providing a collaborative arena to engage, formulate actions and implement solutions for the people and nature in Utah.</p><p>Because many existing groups in Utah are actively working on this theme, we carried out a <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/landscape-assessment\" target=\"_blank\">landscape assessment</a> to synthesize the missions and actions of 27 groups that represent government, higher education, recreation, environment and health care across the Salt Lake Valley.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>We learned that existing and well-played melodies concern nature and health topics in many harmonious keys. For example, many regional organizations are working towards improving air quality, enhancing access to urban green spaces, and providing access to recreational opportunities in schools and summer camps. Others focus on overcoming existing barriers to nature engagement such as transportation, finances and lack of gear, particularly for groups that have been traditionally underrepresented.</p><p>The surveys and interviews we conducted and synthesized allowed us to identify what is, and — more importantly — what is not yet being done. The majority of groups involved in the landscape assessment expressed interest in NHH-UT being a connector and an amplifier of existing work. Other priorities included additional research in the nascent field of nature and human health, more funding for pilot projects, and finding solutions to equitable nature access concerns. A recurring leitmotif was the need for support through political pathways to promote real, sustainable impacts on nature connections for the betterment of the health of people and the environment.</p><p>In October 2023, NHH-UT hosted <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/symposium\" target=\"_blank\">a symposium </a>designed for groups with similar missions to connect, discuss and reduce overlap. This was the first of many activities NHH-UT will provide to harmonize the efforts that engage people with nature. The keynote speaker at the event was Utah Rep. Rosemary Lesser, who spoke on the need to improve health outcomes through holistic approaches and why we, as Utahns, need to pay particular attention to the health of our environment.</p><p>Additionally, 13 community organizations participated in a poster session during the symposium to highlight the work that is currently being done in nature and health and encourage participants to connect with one another based on the issues that are most important to them.</p><p>We also announced that Nature and Human Health will be awarding a second round of <a href=\"https://www.natureandhealthutah.org/pilot-grants\" target=\"_blank\">pilot grants</a> in 2024 for individuals and/or organizations that would like to implement a project that relates to increasing access to the outdoors to improve the health of Utahns. NHH-UT received 15 proposals for projects related to pediatric rheumatology, air quality, bike lane expansions, camping programs for African American families, nature-based summer camps for incarcerated youth, and mental health outdoor programming for women.</p><p>Our group welcomes continuing input and expertise of all individuals and groups who wish to connect Utahns more closely to nature in effective and harmonious ways.</p><p>Learn more about Nature and Human Health-Utah at <a href=\"http://www.natureandhealthutah.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.natureandhealthutah.org</a>.</p><img alt=\"Nalini Nadkarni\" height=\"2792\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/uxSc7054_ryvhXUrjwOnnnfCGqU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/SNICSCRQAVEMHKFVEX4FX4RUPA.jpg\" width=\"3144\" /><br /><caption>Nalini Nadkarni</caption><p><i><b>Nalini Nadkarni</b></i><i>, co-leader of NHH-UT and Professor Emerita at the University of Utah, has interwoven research on forest canopy biota with innovative public engagement throughout her career.

We opened one back in 1974 that was out of Joe Redburn’s bar, and it lasted like for maybe two years, primarily because the community was just too small to support it.” (Redburn opened The Sun, an iconic Salt Lake City gay bar, in 1973.)</p><p><b>Babs Delay, real estate broker and LGBTQ+ activist •</b> “Myself, Joe Redburn and a few other folks created [the first center] near where the bars were downtown.

There were 12 of us, and we marched, two-by-two, up over a little grassy knoll with a flag. That was the opening ceremony.”</p><p><b>Williams •</b> “One of the quotes that we used to have at the old Stonewall Center [was] that ‘community meant communication and unity.’ That’s what community was, and I don’t feel like there is much communication or unity in our broader community [today], and it might be because we have so many different issues. … We’re not the same people that we were in the 1990s, when we started the Stonewall Center.”</p><p><b>Sue Robbins, a transgender organizer who joined UPC around 2008 or 2009, through a group of people who weren’t out yet •</b> “I was able to participate in that group and start to find like people who are trying to explore and understand ourselves. … It let me know I wasn’t alone.

But the state’s largest teacher’s union said it wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>“We cannot overlook the significant shortfall in the proposed 5% increase in the weighted pupil unit (WPU),” union President Renée Pinkney said in a statement. “The proposal falls far below the UEA’s requested 12%, which will leave critical student needs unaddressed.”</p><p>Officials from the governor’s budget and planning office noted that recent years have seen notable increases to the WPU, mostly<b> </b>because of additional revenue from the federal COVID stimulus.</p><p>That wasn’t the case for fiscal year 2021, which saw lawmakers approve<b> </b>the lowest WPU increase the state had seen since 2013 at 1.8%,<b> </b><a href=\"https://budget.utah.gov/getting-schooled-on-education-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">state records show</a>. <a href=\"https://budget.utah.gov/getting-schooled-on-education-funding/\"> </a>But both fiscal 2022 and 2023 saw a 6% increase in WPU, the largest in a decade.</p><p>In the years leading up to the pandemic, fiscal 2016-2020, officials said the average WPU increase was 3.5%.</p><p>“The governor’s [fiscal 2025] budget, which recommends a 5% increase in the WPU, as well as a 5% year-over increase in total education funding, is prudent and responsive to available revenues in an environment of lingering economic uncertainty, while still providing significant investments in our education system,” officials said.</p><p>As the state gears up to redirect <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0215.html\">$42 million of its public education dollars</a> to private schools through the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/01/20/everything-you-need-know-about/\">Utah Fits All Scholarship Program</a> — enough for about 5,000 students to receive $8,000 each toward private school tuition — one national study found that Utah could be spending more.</p><p>The Education Law Center’s annual<a href=\"https://edlawcenter.org/research/making-the-grade-2023.html\"> Making the Grade </a>study reviews public school funding in all 50 states and Washington D.C. This year’s report examined the latest data from the 2020-21 school year and graded each state on three different metrics: funding level, funding distribution and funding effort.</p><p>The methodology excluded federal revenue sources and relied solely on state and local revenues, <b>“</b>because we are primarily interested in the state policies around how schools are funded,” said Danielle Farrie, research director for the Education Law Center.</p><p>Utah placed third-to-last in the nation in the study for average per-pupil spending, totaling approximately $10,907, which is slightly higher than the U.S. Census Bureau’s assessment.

That revenue<b> </b>comes from property taxes, private donations and other local sources.</p><p>The study ranked Utah as the top state for funding distribution, a measure of how much additional funding is allocated to school districts with higher levels of student poverty.</p><p>Utah provided 77% more per-pupil funding to high poverty districts than low-poverty ones on average, the<b> </b>study found. But Utah has a relatively low child poverty rate compared to other states at 8.4%, according to the<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/12/poverty-rate-varies-by-age-groups.html\"> U.S. Census Bureau.</a></p><p>Still, the study found Utah to be a “low-effort” state, meaning its education spending is a small portion of its gross domestic product.</p><p>“The sort of lesson we take from that is that, if Utah wanted to increase its funding to schools, it could enact fiscal policies that would generate more revenue to go into school systems,” Farrie said.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Don’t trust social media, says researcher.

The  church has new rules for creating additional congregations. (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>Previously, there were different requirements based on geography inside the United States and Canada or North America and outside of the United States and North America. With this announcement, which goes into effect as of Jan. 1, there will now be a uniform standard for minimum requirements to create new wards and stakes.</p><p>[For stakes] now what that will be is 150 active, full-tithe-paying <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/09/23/learn-lingo-church-jesus-christ/\">Melchizedek Priesthood</a> holders capable of serving in leadership positions. Previously, it was 120 for other countries and 180 for the United States and Canada. Membership now is just going to be 2,000, regardless of what country the stake would be organized in. Previously, it was 3,000 for the U.S. and Canada and 1,900 for other countries.</p><p>Participating adults — this is a new metric required for creating new stakes and wards — and for a stake, it’s 500 adults that are participating adults and youth is 100, although not required for the youth. These are adults that are participating in church regularly, they pay a full <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/03/26/does-tithing-requirement-for-entry-into-lds-temples-amount-to-mormons-buying-their-way-into-heaven/\">tithe</a>, hold a temple recommend, hold a calling. So these are some fairly strict guidelines for being considered a participating adult.</p><p>Now for the wards, previously it was 300 in the United States and Canada in terms of total membership required to create a new ward, 150 for other countries. Now it’s going to be 250 to create a ward and then also the requirement for the number of active, full-tithe-paying Melchizedek Priesthood holders capable of serving leadership positions will be 20 for all areas where wards are created. Before it was 20 for the U.S. and Canada and 15 for other countries. [The recommendation for] participating adults is now 100 and participating youth is 20.</p><p><i><b>What effect do you believe the new rules will have on congregations in the U.S. and Canada?</b></i></p><p>I do think it’s going to make it easier for the church, of course, to organize new wards in terms of raw membership…but it might make it more difficult in terms of participating adults. So these aren’t just adults that go to church regularly. They have a calling, pay a full tithe, have a temple recommend. Those are pretty significant requirements, and that’ll likely result in a decrease in the creation of new wards in the United States and Canada in the coming years.</p><p>You have to have 500 participating adults to create a new stake. And again, that’s a pretty high number…and that might delay the creation of new wards and stakes.</p><p><i><b>How might they affect growth in the rest of the world?</b></i></p><img alt=\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\\nLatter-day Saints in the Democratic Republic of Congo celebrate their temple in the capital of Kinshasa.\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/Lk8B-WkihSPgM9Flz4PedWmIk28=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/6GNC4ZTKYJBUVNMVMJBV5YAWDU.jpg\" width=\"959\" /><br /><caption>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\\nLatter-day Saints in the Democratic Republic of Congo celebrate their temple in the capital of Kinshasa.</caption><p>We’ll likely see a significant decrease in the number of new stakes and wards being created internationally. …It’s going to be much more common probably for stakes to create more branches instead of wards now and then, hoping that these branches can become large enough to become wards, or maybe just focusing more on smaller congregations of branches instead as a way to bypass some of these more stringent qualifications.</p><p><i><b>Are you a fan of the changes and can you think of maybe a reason why they were put in place?</b></i></p><p>One of the things I really like about these requirements is the lower standard for membership in the United States, just because we have many places in the United States where the church functions much more like it would in Europe or in industrialized East Asia than it would in Utah.</p><p>But you also have many stakes that cover large geographical areas in the Plains states and in the Northeast. And this can allow for creating stakes that are not as large geographically and place less of a burden on on stake leadership to visit and work with the members and leaders in these areas.</p><p>It also is great … because it really takes down this barrier or this distinction between the church in the United States and Canada versus everywhere else. The church should be the same everywhere in terms of how it’s administered in a lot of ways.</p><p>I think the reason why these standards have been updated is that really, across the world, one of the biggest challenges that church has had has been finding these participating men that are able to serve in these leadership positions that women cannot serve in.</p><p><i><b>The church’s news release says nothing, at least explicitly, about women or the all-female Relief Society. Should those numbers be part of the equation?</b></i></p><p>That’s a really interesting question. … My initial response to that is that has not been a problem the church has had in terms of participating women. And so I think the reason why these standards have been updated is that, really, across the world, one of the biggest challenges the church has had has been finding these participating men that are able to serve in these leadership positions that women cannot serve in.</p><p><i><b>What messaging does it send by not mentioning women or the Relief Society in the requirements?

I can’t think of any examples of where that’s happened. There are branches that are almost entirely made up of men, and there are branches that are almost entirely made up of women, and that’s not just in a correctional facility setting. That includes branches and isolated areas. For example, there’s a branch in Mongolia that serves a mining complex, and I believe that branch is probably entirely made up of men.</p><p>And then also you have branches that are almost entirely made up of women, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/local/2017/12/24/mormon-congregations-in-hong-kong-unlike-any-others-theyre-virtually-all-women-and-they-dont-just-hold-services-on-sundays/\">especially in Hong Kong</a>. There are branches there where there are housekeepers and women doing those types of jobs there from other countries, a lot of times from the Philippines.</p><p><i><b>Let’s talk about the new study, which made headlines, saying that self-identifying Latter-day Saints make up 42%, less than half, of Utah’s population. What did you think of that finding?</b></i></p><p>I was totally not surprised.

And it’s just not correct. It’s never been correct. If you go back to 1920, only 60% of the population of the state of Utah was on church records. That’s lower than it is now.</p><p>It has ebbed and flowed a little bit over time, but roughly speaking in the last century, it’s really been about two thirds of the state population have been on the church’s records as members. And in terms of the activity rate in Utah, that’s typically been about 50% overall for quite some time, at least the last few decades.</p><p>If you take that approximately two-thirds of the state population [are] Latter-day Saints and you take half of that, that’s 33%. That’s lower than the number that’s reported in the study, which was 42%.</p><p>So the thing that was really neat with this study is that then we’re able to get an idea of, OK what are the number of people in Utah who do not appear to attend church really at all or have any measurements of activity — how many of those people still identify as a Latter-day Saint? And that comes out to about 10% of the population of Utah…. There’s been a lot of information that you see on social media where people make it sound like the church is just falling apart. And that’s just not true. … Furthermore, the rate of stakes and wards and branches being created in Utah has been so consistent for the past 20 years at about 400 members per ward or branch in Utah, and that hasn’t really changed much.</p><p><i><b>Where do you peg the activity rate in the church around the world?</b></i></p><p>For the United States, approximately 40%....

It was made up of some 300 grade school kids at a northern Utah elementary, curious young minds who were gathered at an assembly meant to promote drinking milk and eating nutritious foods.</p><p>Now, that eager, feisty crowd got a bonus — a chance to hear from and ask a real-live NFL quarterback a couple fistfuls of questions, easy and tough ones.</p><p>Programming note: At that point in his career, Smith had done notable, improbable things, including leading the Utah Utes to an undefeated season, being named a college All-American, becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, ascending to the position of starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for a handful of seasons, suffering and fighting his way through difficult injuries, being called soft by his clueless coach — “That was hard to take,” he said — for figuring it was better for him not to play with a serious shoulder separation, tearing three ligaments, and, later, after he recovered, losing his starting job to a fellow named J.T. O’Sullivan, a scrub QB who had been a backup for seven different teams before stealing the wheel from Smith in San Francisco.</p><p>Questions, kids?</p><p>After being asked what he liked to do other than play football — “snowboard, bowl, watch movies and read” — and what he ate for breakfast — “Cinnamon Toast Crunch” — and what his favorite football memory was — “beating BYU my last year at the University of Utah” — and who the hardest team he ever played against was — “I’ve played a lot of hard teams in the NFL” — Smith stared down and stumbled over the most problematic inquiry of all: Why do you like playing football?</p><p>“Um … uh … Good question.”</p><p>At that juncture in his journey, a steamroller of a question.</p><p>As Smith was announced on Sunday as a part of the 2024 class of the College Football Hall of Fame, that question burrowed deep into my mind. He fumbled and bumbled around with it on that particular occasion, but Smith could have responded with a drop-dead sincere, “To set a determined example for those who watch me.”</p><p>If the best quarterback who ever played at Utah is to be remembered for anything, and there are a lot of things in college and in the pros, paramount among his attributes and achievements would be his dogged steadfastness in hacking his way through challenges — and the grace and courage it took to do so.</p><p>Alums and fans of many schools seek to find, embrace and celebrate one of their own of whom they can be proud, and Smith more than qualifies for that status among Utes.</p><p>Who can forget the way he battled back from the cruel leg injury he suffered late in his 16-year NFL career, an injury that literally could have killed the man, subsequently being named the league’s Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.</p><p>That was emblematic of the extremes Smith faced during his pro playing days, overcoming them enough to do more than throw for 35,650 yards and 199 touchdowns, earning three Pro Bowl invitations, while playing for San Francisco, Kansas City and Washington. It garnered for him lofty respect from teammates, most of his coaches, team executives, opposing players and fans. Not bad for a quarterback who initially was labeled by some critics a bust, who was the understudy of four different offensive coordinators over his first four NFL seasons, and who possessed the fortitude to fight on.</p><p>When he spoke to the elementary school kids all those years ago, he openly wondered how a game that had been so good to him at Utah could have turned its back on him, seemingly laughing at his pain, in the NFL. All as he knew he was talented enough, intelligent enough, capable enough to thrive at the highest level of football.</p><p>“It’s been hard,” he said, after the youngsters filed back to class. “When you struggle, when you’re hurt, you’re kind of out of sight, out of mind.”</p><p>Out of sorts.</p><p>It deterred and defeated him not in a manner enough to derail his intentions. He may not have lived up to his 2005 draft position, at least not the way some folks consider it, but Smith’s career passing yardage ranks him among the top 35 NFL quarterbacks all-time.</p><p>Utah — and no other school — could have known completely the vastness of Smith’s future capabilities, being the only FBS school that wanted him just more than 20 years ago, but the Utes did recognize some of his potential and most of his intelligence. Smith eventually was named to the Academic All-America Hall of Fame.</p><p>At the start of the 2003 season, Smith wasn’t even named Utah’s starter — until Brett Elliott got hurt. That’s when he launched into a memorable time at Utah, passing for 5,203 yards and 47 touchdowns, rushing for 1,072 yards and 15 scores. He still holds school records for career pass efficiency (164.42) and yards per completion (13.38). Most significantly, Smith quarterbacked the best team — in 2004 — in Utah’s football history, the team that went unbeaten and won the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1, 2005.</p><p>“I think we would have beaten anybody that year,” he said. “We executed so well. We had athletes. We were so solid. We were good, better even than the [2008] team.”</p><p>As elevated as Smith’s play was — and this says much about him as a humble soul — he said he had no clue the NFL would come calling. “It was surreal. I played that whole season in college and never had a single inkling that the NFL was a possibility.”</p><p>It was … 16 years of it.</p><p>And that span, that reach, gave Smith an opportunity to expand the example of his dogged courage and determination beyond football, starting a foundation that provides foster teens with tools necessary to transition to successful adulthood via means such as education, mentoring, advocacy, etc.</p><p>When Smith was inducted into the Utah Athletics Hall of Fame a few years back, he said: “One school gave me a chance. That was the U. and I’m grateful for it. It changed my life, shaped who I am today.”</p><p>Ahh. That pretty much satisfies the schoolboy’s long-ago question, the one regarding why Alex Smith liked playing football.</p><p>Good question then. Good answer now.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Here’s what a day in the life of the Utah Jazz dancers looks like',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Here’s what a day in the life of the Utah Jazz dancers looks like'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/08/beyond-sequins-smiles-hours-work/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Palak Jayswal'}],\n   'author': 'Palak Jayswal',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Palak Jayswal'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 18:52:58 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=18, tm_min=52, tm_sec=58, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'A day with the Utah Jazz Dancers, from solitary rehearsal time in an empty arena to performing in front of thousands in the Delta Center — putting in the work while knowing \"we\\'re not the main event.\"',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'A day with the Utah Jazz Dancers, from solitary rehearsal time in an empty arena to performing in front of thousands in the Delta Center — putting in the work while knowing \"we\\'re not the main event.\"'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Like most sports teams, the Utah Jazz Dancers have their pre-game rituals.</p><p>Team captain Halle Santiago leads 21 other dancers through their warmups, before the state’s NBA franchise hosts the Brooklyn Nets at Delta Center on Dec. 18.</p><p>The room where they warm up is also their dressing room, where an hour earlier the dancers sat on the floor, in front of mirrors, curling their hair and applying mascara and the red lipstick that matches the holiday-themed outfits hanging above them in their cubbies.

Kelson attended the University of Utah, and trained in the U.’s dance program.</p><p>When her time dancing for the Jazz ended, Kelson said she wanted to stay in sports, which led to her involvement with sports sponsorships. She approached Steve Starks, then the team’s president (now the CEO of the Larry H. Miller Company), about growing the Jazz Dancers program. After giving a presentation, Kelson said, Starks asked her to lead the team.</p><p>“We’re just trying to grow and evolve the program,” Kelson said. “From where I was as a dancer, I don’t know if I could keep up with half of the routines the current dancers are doing right now.”</p><p>Kelson’s rapport with the dancers is evident. During their afternoon rehearsals before the Brooklyn game, the coach and the dancers communicate about what is and isn’t working. They practice their spacing, being careful to stay within a narrow section of the court because space is precious. They refer to lines on the court that aren’t visible from the stands or on TV.</p><p>The dancers fine-tune their moves, making sure angles are clean, marks are hit, poses are crisp, as their matching white Nike sneakers hit the floor in rhythm.</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune)\" height=\"3959\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/UvIylXJ-doFnXzU_WUXZzeO_p_s=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/APGPAVTJKVFKFEALBUXZRGWCC4.JPG\" width=\"5938\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>The team’s work extends beyond the court, Kelson said.</p><p>“There’s a lot that goes in business hours outside of practice and games as well,” Kelson said. “Besides showing up many hours before tipoff on a game day, they are heavily involved in community appearances” — such as volunteering at VA hospitals or with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. “The importance of being a role model to youth is so important,” she said.</p><p>Meet the dancers</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/jazz/dancers\">dancers on the team</a> are young, their ages ranging from 18 to 27. Some are full-time students, while others have jobs outside their obligations as Jazz Dancers. (The dancers are compensated, a representative of the Jazz’s corporate communications team said, but the franchise would not disclose how much they’re paid.)</p><p>Jayden Herman, for example, is in his second season with the dance team, helps coach drill teams at Cyprus and Granger high schools, and works as a manager at <a href=\"https://fiizdrinks.com/\">FiiZ drinks</a>. Herman said dedication, passion and the time commitment are a big part of the job.</p><p>“My senior year, I was actually the first boy on our drill team at Granger High School,” Herman said. Though he tried out and made it, he wasn’t able to perform at things outside school events. “They said that I wasn’t allowed to compete because it was a sanctioned only-girls sport, but it was still fun,” he explained.</p><p>Herman is one of three male dancers on the Jazz’s squad. Male dancers first appeared on the team in the 2021-2022 season, though Kelson said they were always allowed to join. She said it was a natural next step for where the program is going.</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jayden Herman performs with the Utah Jazz Dancers on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024.\" height=\"1704\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/7moE9ayNqXB-Hk059cN7sXUScys=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/ICJHUWNNFNAH7FYDJO2INXZHWQ.JPG\" width=\"2500\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Jayden Herman performs with the Utah Jazz Dancers on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024. (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>“Once they started letting boys on it, it was so inclusive,” Herman said. “You didn’t see, like, ‘Oh, the girls are doing this and the boys are doing this.’ It’s like they’re doing it as a team together.”</p><p>For several seasons, the dance team’s racial makeup was — like the state of Utah itself — predominantly white. The team’s first Black dancers <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/jazz/dancers?t=1617\">joined in 2016</a>; this season’s team has several performers of color. (The Utah Jazz have long been at the center of conversations about Utah’s racial culture. For example, former Jazz star Donovan Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/01/10/donovan-mitchell-draining/\">made news in early 2023</a> when he discussed the pressure he felt as a well-known Black person in Utah.)</p><p>“We are always looking for the best dancer — not only dancer, but well-rounded person in general,” Kelson said. “It’s not all about the dance, and it’s not all about looks, per se, but, you know, how is their mental health? Can they handle criticism of what a fan might say?”</p><p>Auditions are held every year, before the season starts. This season, 11 team members are rookies, and 11 are returning performers.</p><p>“You have to have the skill. You have to have the talent,” said Santiago, who is returning for her third season with the Jazz Dancers, and her second as team captain. “They’re looking for very well-trained professional dancers, but they’re also looking for amazing people.”</p><p>(One indication of their dance skills can be seen in a video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/utahjazzdancers/\">the team’s Instagram account</a> — in which dancers try to guess what choreography a teammate is performing behind them, going only by the sound of their feet on the floor.)</p><p>Santiago — who’s from Provo and also teaches dance — said she loves that she gets to dance in her home state.</p><p>“I grew up dancing collegiately, and so coming from that, my favorite part of that was being at the sporting events,” said Santiago, a former member of the <a href=\"https://byucougars.com/sports/cougarettes\">Brigham Young University Cougarettes</a>. “I’ve always had my eye on the Jazz Dancers, just because Utah is known for their dance. They produce such great dancers.”</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Halle Santiago.\" height=\"3958\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/KUprlshsAuP5PrL7jRJrTURby34=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/TCFG3ZVUZJA63PZGOSYFTF7HBY.JPG\" width=\"5818\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Halle Santiago.

She attended Pleasant Grove High School, and coached that school’s drill team for a few years.</p><p>“My favorite part is just getting to dance again,” Thorley said. “But a huge part of that is being on a team and performing again, and just being a part of something way bigger than me again.”</p><p>Kelson added that, “Here in Utah, I would say this is an opportunity … to be a part of, as a dancer [at the highest level].”</p><p>‘The bigger picture’</p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Halle Santiago and Nicole Thorley lead the dancers off the court after player introductions.\" height=\"2920\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/uUwOeFvRQ9ln8PDuDir6R6iL5Yk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/HQMVQZCN7RBF7H7FY2DUCTUX7Y.JPG\" width=\"4025\" /><br /><caption>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Halle Santiago and Nicole Thorley lead the dancers off the court after player introductions. (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>The Jazz Dancers also deal with the reality that they are just one part of the spectacle of an NBA game — and that fans may be more focused on the players, or heading to the concession stands, while the dancers are performing.</p><p>“It’s always the bigger picture, with entertainment and everything,” Kelson said. “People are coming to see a game, and so we understand. … Yes, unfortunately, we aren’t the main event.”</p><p>The ultimate goal for the Jazz Dancers, Kelson said, is to create connections — whether fans see them on the court, on the concourse or in public appearances around the community.</p><p>“The more we can build those relationships and those connections,” Kelson said, “we can trick them a little bit to stay in their seats a little bit longer.”</p><p>Santiago noted that “no one’s ever going to really realize what it takes to get to this level. They just see the pretty package with the bow tied on top.”</p><p>As a dancer, Santiago said, “The work is always more than worth it. … It’s not gratification from the outside. It’s definitely gratification from the inside, and all the work that we put in even when no one’s watching.”</p><p>When the Jazz Dancers step on to the court at halftime on Dec. 18, a lot is happening. Bear, the Jazz mascot, is incorporated into the dancers’ routine — acting as the DJ, flipping through the songs they’re dancing to. Those fans who have stayed to watch are singing along to the holiday hits.</p><p>It all comes together, with wild waves of hair, dazzling smiles and perfect execution.</p><p>During the second half, the dancers return to the court during timeouts, deploying a t-shirt cannon to give out prizes. By the end of the night, fans got another prize: The Jazz beat the Nets, 125-108 — the first of five wins over the team’s last seven games of December.</p><p>“When a fan comes in,” Kelson said, “it’s more than just seeing a person in a really pretty uniform. It’s not just about dance — but who these dancers are, even outside of this, and how hard they’re working at their jobs or trying to get an education or helping their families out.”</p><p>Santiago said, “People just see the glitz and glam of it all and think, ‘Oh, they’re just these pretty dancers on the court.’ … We’re hard-working athletes. We put in a lot of time and effort and energy outside of practice to get to that pretty picture.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

McCarthy</a> are both so talented, and yet, they could not be more different. One thing is for sure, though: They are both likely to play on Sundays, only adding to the high stakes for the College Football Playoff final.</p><p>Granted, McCarthy has not announced his intentions yet and has until Jan. 15 to do so, but for the sake of this discussion, let’s assume he’s going to enter the 2024 NFL Draft. Here’s how I see the two QBs entering the biggest game of their careers.</p><p></p><p>Michael Penix Jr. (6-foot-3, 212 pounds)</p><img alt=\"Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. looks to throw against Washington State during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023, in Seattle.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) (Lindsey Wasson/)</caption><p>Penix operates very comfortably from the pocket. He can buy time with subtle movements or even tuck the ball and run for a first down. He seldom seems to panic and is often effective late in the down. He has the arm strength to make all the throws, and he’s had the best deep ball in college football this year. He has a natural feel for the correct trajectory and touch on most throws. That is hard to coach. He also has the arm strength and confidence to fit balls into tight windows from either college hash and can be surgical with his accuracy and ball placement.</p><p>An underrated trait is his ability to alter his arm angle and get the ball out quickly. Watching left-handed quarterbacks can sometimes play tricks on even the best evaluators because they don’t see a lot of releases from that side. To me, one question Penix answered recently is his ability to throw without having his feet set or under him. Some see his delivery as being a little long, but I think it can be sped up, and at times, he shows he can really get the ball out of his hand quickly.</p><p>Penix has excellent vision downfield in identifying targets and reading coverage. His decision-making is solid, and because of his patience, he can let plays develop before he pulls the trigger. His anticipation and trust in his receivers and the system allow him to make some throws that are impossible to defend. You rarely see this at the college level. The word that best describes Penix for me is <i>polished</i>.</p><p>J.J. McCarthy (6-3, 202)</p><img alt=\"Michigan quarterback J.J.

McCarthy (9) throws against Indiana in the first half of an NCAA college football game in Ann Arbor, Mich., Saturday, Oct. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Paul Sancya/)</caption><p>McCarthy has an advantage in this comparison with his legs. He can make things happen on scrambles and designed QB runs in a more explosive way than Penix. He can elude pressure, but at times, he seems hurried and will bolt too quickly.</p><p>He has a really strong arm, even by NFL standards. Tight-window throws and confidence are not an issue. Sometimes, McCarthy will take an unneeded risk because he thinks he can make any throw, but I get it. He has an easy throwing motion; the ball comes off his hand smoothly, and I definitely consider him a <i>passer</i> as opposed to a <i>thrower</i> (there is a difference). He has a feel for touch on shorter routes and throws a catchable ball for the most part. He does not have many targets with top-level NFL ball skills, so some incompletions will become completions at the next level.</p><p>McCarthy has good vision downfield from the pocket, but a lot of his throws have come off of play-action or on RPOs where targets are predetermined. That means there is slightly less on his shoulders to determine who to throw to. The play call often decides where the ball is going, and he knows this before he leaves the huddle. He has natural instincts and feel in the pocket, vision downfield and the ability to anticipate receivers coming open, so I have no doubt about him in a timing-based offensive scheme, especially once he has more experience.</p><p>Factoring schemes and responsibilities</p><img alt=\"(Butch Dill | AP) Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. celebrates after the Sugar Bowl CFP NCAA semifinal college football game between Washington and Texas, Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024, in New Orleans.

Washington won 37-31. (Butch Dill/)</caption><p>Penix is a sixth-year player who spent his first four seasons at Indiana, all of which <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5166936/2023/12/29/michael-penix-washington-indiana-emotional-physical-health/\">ended with injuries</a> (which will affect his status with some NFL teams), before following Kalen DeBoer — the former Hoosiers offensive coordinator who is now the Huskies’ head coach — to Washington <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5181121/2024/01/05/michael-penix-washington-transfer-portal-will-rogers/\">via the transfer portal</a>. Sometimes, the NFL frowns on players who spend an extra year in college, but in my opinion, it has helped Penix in so many ways. He has clearly mastered this offensive scheme, and it took time to build the confidence and poise he now shows.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/team/indiana-hoosiers-college-football/\">Indiana</a>, these results were not possible. Penix lacked the pocket presence and the ability to process information like he will need to at the next level. But now, he has reached the top tier of the learning curve. He might be the most polished of all quarterbacks in this draft class — at least from the pocket — and that includes everyone’s presumed No. 1 choice, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/player/caleb-williams-oOKwyoc07OTLmXZN/\">Caleb Williams</a> from <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/college-football/team/usc-trojans-college-football/\">USC</a>. Penix has proved he can operate from the pocket, whether clean or muddy, at a different level.</p><p>McCarthy’s path here has been much different. He is just three years removed from high school and 20 years old. His tools — off-the-charts arm strength and athleticism to extend plays and produce on designed runs — are his calling card. He has less than half as many pass attempts (695) as Penix (1,634), so naturally his processing speed is a bit behind the Huskies QB.</p><p>Here is the other side of that coin, though: NFL evaluators can identify McCarthy’s traits, and his lack of reps might give him a higher ceiling once he masters his trade. Where would he be in Year 6 of his development? It makes for a fascinating comparison that will no doubt lead to hours of discussion within NFL buildings if McCarthy does enter the draft this year.</p><p>Some scouts struggle with the lack of sophistication of the Wolverines’ passing game, especially compared to Washington’s and what Penix is asked to do. I think McCarthy has been asked to do less when it comes to pre-snap administration of the offense. Penix runs a master class managing the Huskies’ offense before the snap, overseeing varied alignments, motions and shifts, and gathering pass protection intel. I have no doubt McCarthy can do the same — it just requires a leap of faith because it’s not as evident at this point.</p><p>Put another way, Penix runs a system that accentuates his skills perfectly and has a proven track record of production to go with his talent. As we saw in the semifinal game, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/5173921/2024/01/02/washington-texas-sugar-bowl-score-result-takeaways/\">he is playing at a very high level</a>. Meanwhile, McCarthy runs a system that might not be perfect for his talent or skill set, which will require more projection when assessing him at the next level in a more complicated system.</p><p>Assessing intangibles</p><img alt=\"Michigan quarterback J.J.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (AJ Mast/)</caption><p>NFL scouts are much further along in gathering intangible information on Penix. He has been listed with all other senior prospects all year long. This means scouts have been able to ask Washington coaches and staffers questions — about Penix’s background information, leadership, work habits, medical information, etc. — freely on school visits throughout the fall.</p><p>That information is very tricky to gather on players who might be returning for another year, like McCarthy, especially at a place like Michigan, which has been known to not always be open with its information to visiting scouts. Gathering character and background information on McCarthy is a much different process for scouts than it was for Penix.</p><p>Off-field information is a big part of the evaluation process. Those of us on the outside are not as plugged in as scouts and NFL executives, and for quarterbacks, this part of their file might be even more important than their arm strength. If these things check out, I could see either of these guys being top-10 picks, maybe even higher, in April.</p><p>Comparisons</p><p>NFL decision-makers usually like their scouts to give some type of reference or comparison to another player at the same position with a similar style of game. For example, I used John Elway as a comparison for <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/josh-allen-9zLTUSPpy6pFa4xs/\">Josh Allen</a> when he was coming out. That didn’t mean I saw Allen as another Elway. It meant that Allen’s size, style and skill set were similar to Elway’s. <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> defensive coordinator Vic Fangio made the same comparison this week in preparing for their game against the <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/bills/\">Bills</a>.</p><p>For McCarthy, I see the upside of a Jim Kelly, if he were to be inserted into the K-Gun system of yesteryear’s Buffalo Bills. For younger readers, he’s a less polished <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/cj-stroud-OiILdmCU0Ie4L8vg/\">C.J. Stroud</a>, with major upside.</p><p>As for Penix, I’m dating myself again, but he reminds me of another Huskies great: He is a left-handed Warren Moon with an uncanny ability to throw the deep ball and instincts and touch that can’t be coached.</p><p>Bottom line</p><p>Trying to predict how Penix and McCarthy will be picked without a complete evaluation is really difficult. Their talent tells me they are worthy of being top-10 picks, but that will be affected by the quality of the draft at other positions as well.</p><p>With certainty though, a college game of this magnitude will carry more weight than almost any other in the eyes of coaches and scouts. Bright lights are a big part of any evaluation. Teams will decide who is the best fit for their systems. One player might be more polished, but the other might have more upside.</p><p>The order of QB1 through QB5 in this class is about to get interesting in draft rooms across the NFL.

John Johnson, R-North Ogden, </a>who will be leading at least one of the proposals when the session starts on Jan. 16. “This is an effort now that’s much bigger than me.”</p><p>Diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs in higher education are meant to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, including race and ethnicity, as well as single parents or individuals with disabilities, to help them through college.</p><p>But Republicans in Utah — and across the nation — have said the initiatives have gotten out of hand. Cox said he is concerned by how much money is spent on the diversity offices at Utah’s schools and suggested he hasn’t seen the outcomes to support that funding. He also railed against colleges requiring what he called “diversity statements you have to sign to get hired,” <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">saying the practice is “bordering on evil.”</a></p><img alt=\"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Gov.

Spencer Cox speaks to media during a monthly news conference in Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2023. (Rick Egan/)</caption><p>During a news conference last month that has drawn widespread attention, the governor said: “I can assure you after this legislative session, it will not be happening here in the state of Utah.”</p><p>The state’s eight public colleges and universities <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/21/gov-cox-shares-no-evidence-that/\" target=\"_blank\">have said those statements don’t exist in the way Cox described,</a> though some acknowledged they ask employees to write a statement about their own beliefs regarding equity and diversity as part of their job application. Meanwhile, students and employees have spoken out in support of what diversity offices accomplish in buoying those who might be at a disadvantage coming into higher education.</p><p>It is shaping into a battleground topic in the ongoing culture wars and one of the most anticipated discussions to come during the 45-day legislative session — where it’s expected to hit fast and early.</p><p>Here is what we know so far about the three bills being drafted by Republican legislators to hem in DEI initiatives across the state.</p><p>One lawmaker’s says he wants ‘fairness for everybody’</p><p>Last year, Johnson made waves toward the end of the session when he introduced <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/SB0283.html\" target=\"_blank\">a bill to eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion offices and leadership positions at Utah’s public universities.</a></p><p>The senator, who has also led the charge against discussions of racism in K-12 classrooms, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/27/republican-lawmaker-pulls-his-too/\" target=\"_blank\">quickly shelved the bill after outcry</a> — including <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/24/utahs-only-black-lawmaker-speaks/\" target=\"_blank\">an impassioned speech from Utah’s only Black state lawmaker, Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City,</a> as well as comments from University of Utah President Taylor Randall.</p><img alt=\"(Bethany Baker  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Rep.

Sandra Hollins speaks during a session of the Utah House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2023. (Bethany Baker/)</caption><p>At the time Johnson said he recognized his proposal was “too harsh” and promised to crowdsource and revise it for this year.</p><p>Johnson told The Salt Lake Tribune that he has done that, though he said he still is working out final details and declined to comment specifically on what the bill aims at. “I still kind of want to be flexible,” he said.</p><p>But the senator said that his bill will tackle what he sees as “fairness for everybody” at public colleges. He believes when university offices support specific student populations, like Latino or Black students, it is divisive and exclusionary to others.</p><p>“We need to focus efforts at universities on students and individuals, rather than groups,” he said. “It needs to be focused and fair to everyone.”</p><p>He said he has heard that more students of color are first-generation college students than white students, which is true. But instead of focusing on those students of color, he said, and excluding white students who might also be the first in their families to attend school, he would rather see an office for all first-generation students — which he sees as making access more broad and available to all instead of a few.</p><p>Similarly, he would rather see efforts to support students from families living below the poverty level than offices based on race or ethnicity. He described it as “basing it on a demographic characteristic rather than the color of someone’s skin.”</p><p>Johnson said he doesn’t want state money spent “to help one group over another simply because of their membership to a group.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/02/27/republican-lawmaker-pulls-his-too/\" target=\"_blank\">Last year, Johnson said roughly $11 million is spent on DEI programs </a>at Utah colleges and universities every year — a number he said came from legislative research. That is taxpayer funded, and he feels there is an obligation to spend it in a way that yields notable results.</p><p>When asked what outcomes a DEI office would need to show to be seen as successful, Johnson did not have specific examples but instead pointed to the governor also questioning what metrics the programs are hitting.</p><p>“There’s a clear role of education and making people better citizens and more productive citizens,” Johnson said. “And if we don’t have a return on that investment, we have to ask ourselves, why are we doing this? What are we getting in return?”</p><p>He said part of his drive, too, comes from the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling to ban affirmative action — meant to open opportunities for individuals from minority and underrepresented backgrounds — with university acceptances. He would like to see colleges, in general, stop focusing on race.</p><p>He feels, with those efforts, higher education has moved away from its mission to educate students — and has started to be biased against conservatives who attend or work there. He says they need to do more to embrace “viewpoint diversity.”</p><p>“This is a case where the pendulum has swung too far from where it was,” he said.</p><p>Johnson started as a professor at the University of Mississippi. He took a break, started a software company, and then returned as a professor at Utah State University. In the time in between, he said: “Having been inside that system and seen what’s happening, it’s more difficult for a conservative within the system than it was when I first started.”</p><p>He said he supports the recent initiative measure from the Utah System of Higher Education that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/12/02/gov-cox-doesnt-want-utah-colleges/\" target=\"_blank\">mandates the leadership of public universities in the state be neutral on political issues</a>. It also puts limitations on student speech, including that one group cannot shout down another — even if they disagree on an issue or feel it’s hate speech.</p><p>That came after <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/11/17/university-utah-withdrew-its/\" target=\"_blank\">a student group at the University of Utah, MECHA, had its sponsorship pulled </a>after the school said it disrupted a conservative club’s event that was critical of the transgender community.</p><p>Johnson said he wants to see universities embrace and support “viewpoint diversity” going forward.</p><p>Another legislator looks at university ‘litmus tests’</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/HALLK/\" target=\"_blank\">Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden,</a> similarly ran a bill on DEI last session that she is looking to revive.</p><p>Her previous attempt sought to ban schools — both public colleges and K-12 schools — from asking an applicant anything about their work to further inclusion and diversity. It passed through the House, but got held up in a Senate committee.</p><p>The idea was in line with what Cox has recently been targeting in his statements.</p><p>Hall did not respond to several requests to talk to The Tribune for this story, but a spokesperson for the Utah House sent a statement from her.</p><p>In that, Hall said she is “concerned by the countless examples of litmus tests required by Utah’s higher education institutions” in hiring faculty and staff. That’s what she said she intends to look at with her proposal this session.</p><p>She said she has been working with “lawmakers, the executive branch, professors, and higher education stakeholders to better understand DEI requirements and find a path forward that creates equal opportunities for all.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/5/24026683/utah-lawmaker-points-to-university-of-utah-job-postings-in-push-against-diversity-statements\" target=\"_blank\">Hall recently told KSL</a> that she is worried by how many job postings for the state’s public colleges and universities require applicants to provide a comment on their diversity beliefs. She estimated that 15-20% of the University of Utah’s applications included that.</p><p>A representative examines all employers and DEI beliefs</p><p>A third bill for this session looks at DEI — but while it includes public universities, it isn’t limited to just them.</p><p><a href=\"https://house.utleg.gov/rep/JIMENT/\" target=\"_blank\">Rep. Tim Jimenez, R-Tooele,</a> wants to make sure that all employers in the state, both public and private, do not have any kind of requirement for an employee to sign a paper or check a box promising to agree to any beliefs on diversity or inclusion.</p><p>He said employers have a First Amendment right to say what their company stands for. But, he added, employees have the same right not to be compelled to agree to something they don’t believe.</p><p>Jimenez said he has heard from state employees who have expressed concern about this, which spurred him to look into the issue.</p><p>He sees it as a continuation of his efforts from last session, with <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0427.html\" target=\"_blank\">HB427</a>, focused on what he calls “individual freedom” in education. That bill passed and was signed into law and now prohibits K-12 schools from teaching students that they are responsible for any past racism, sexism or other discrimination.</p><p>That bill was an offshoot of<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/05/19/protest-over-critical/\" target=\"_blank\"> the Legislature’s earlier effort to ban from K-12 schools any discussion of critical race theory</a>, a college-level academic framework that posits that the country’s institutions were formed from racist principles. There is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2022/10/21/utah-auditors-see-no-evidence/\" target=\"_blank\">no evidence that was being widely taught here.</a></p><p>Jimenez said his new bill now takes that same idea and puts it in the workplace.</p><img alt=\"(Courtesy photo) Pictured is Rep.

Tim Jimenez. </caption><p>He said he hasn’t figured out all of the mechanics of it yet — including what limitations the state could place on private employers.</p><p>“That’s the area we’re working in to get everything in the language right,” he said. “We want people to have jobs. But we don’t want people to not be employed because they practice their own beliefs.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Former BYU receiver Puka Nacua sets NFL rookie records for receiving yards, catches',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Former BYU receiver Puka Nacua sets NFL rookie records for receiving yards, catches'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/07/former-byu-receiver-puka-nacua/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/07/former-byu-receiver-puka-nacua/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2024/01/07/former-byu-receiver-puka-nacua/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Athletic'}],\n   'author': 'The Athletic',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Athletic'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 01:37:18 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=1, tm_min=37, tm_sec=18, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': 'Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua set NFL rookie records for catches (105) and receiving yards (1,486) this season.',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua set NFL rookie records for catches (105) and receiving yards (1,486) this season.'},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><b>Santa Clara, Calif. •</b> With a 7-yard catch in the third quarter of Sunday’s Week 18 game against San Francisco, Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua broke the NFL rookie receiving yards record long held by former Houston Oilers receiver Bill Groman.</p><p>Groman’s initial high mark of 1,473 yards has stood since 1960, and he achieved it in 13 games in the 14-game season.</p><p>A catch one play later meant that Nacua also broke the rookie record for receptions, held by Jaylen Waddle (2021). Nacua was then substituted out of the game.</p><p>Nacua will end his rookie season with new high marks of 105 catches and 1,486 yards.</p><p>The Rams won the game 21020.</p><p>A fifth-round draft pick out of Brigham Young, Nacua has recorded over 100 yards in seven games this season, tying the rookie record set by Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 and matched by Justin Jefferson in 2020 (both first-round draft picks). With receiver Cooper Kupp recovering from a hamstring injury to start the 2023 season, Nacua burst onto the NFL scene. His 59 catches in his first eight games set an NFL record for all players. Entering the Week 18 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, Nacua ranked No. 4 in receiving yards (1,445) and No. 8 in catches (101).</p><p>The Rams sat several starters Sunday because they are assured a playoff spot next week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, Kupp, running back Kyren Williams, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and inside linebacker Ernest Jones all were out. Tight end Tyler Higbee (shoulder) and offensive lineman Joe Noteboom (foot) also didn’t play due to injuries. The 49ers also elected to rest starting quarterback Brock Purdy ahead of their playoff stretch.</p><p>Carson Wentz, whom the Rams signed during their Week 10 bye, started for them on Sunday.</p><p>Wednesday, Wentz said “we’ll do our best” to get Nacua the record, adding, “he’s a stud. Puka’s been a stud. Seeing it from afar, but then coming in here and seeing it up close and personal … I don’t know if he really knows how good he is. He’s still a kid, but I think the sky’s the limit for him and it’s cool that he’s getting the recognition that he is and hopefully he can get that record.”</p><p>Rams coach Sean McVay also said Wednesday that the team would be “smart with” Nacua although they wanted to give him the opportunity to “do something special.”</p><p>There’s another interesting layer to Nacua’s milestone. Some senior members of the Rams’ scouting department, plus general manager Les Snead, once worked with Groman after his playing days in Atlanta.</p><p>Snead and senior personnel executives Brian Xanders and Taylor Morton learned from Groman in the Falcons scouting department and Morton ultimately was promoted to Southwest area scout upon Groman’s retirement in 2003. Groman was deeply admired by the three younger scouts.</p><p>Twenty years later, Snead, Morton and Xanders were among those with the Rams who scouted and drafted the player who broke Groman’s record.</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Alex Smith, Randy Moss to enter College Football Hall of Fame'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2024/01/07/alex-smith-randy-moss-enter/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'The Athletic'}],\n   'author': 'The Athletic',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'The Athletic'},\n   'published': 'Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:24:10 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=0, tm_min=24, tm_sec=10, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=8, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Former Utah quarterback Alex Smith and former Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss are the first two inductees announced for the College Football Hall of Fame's 2024 class.

I mean, I’m human,” George said Saturday night after totaling six points, three assists, and two rebounds in 16:01 of court time against the Sixers. “It’s gonna take some time to get back to where I was and try to figure out times be aggressive and times where you’re trying to get people involved.”</p><p>His performance vs. Philly was a microcosm of his play since his return.</p><p>It was assumed upon George being cleared for action that his bench role was temporary, a protective measure enacted as he navigated training staff-imposed minutes restrictions and regained his game conditioning and timing.</p><p>Teammate <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/12/27/utah-jazz-coach-will-hardy-mightve/\" target=\"_blank\">Collin Sexton</a>’s recent explosion of efficient productivity, though, threw a wrench into those plans.

And we’re trying to break him of that habit.”</p><p>The coach elaborated that a 50% shooter in the league typically doesn’t follow a miss one/make one/miss one/make one pattern. Players sometimes brick in bunches, but they need to maintain the mindset that the next one will go in if they are to remain effective.</p><p>“Keyonte will have moments where he’ll miss a few shots in a row and then he sort of backs off,” Hardy added. “That comes from a good place. He’s a good player, he has a good concept of being a part of the team, he likes to move the ball. [But] when he doesn’t see a few go in, I think he starts to overcompensate a little bit.”</p><p>In Saturday’s first half, George was on the court for all of 6 minutes and 27 seconds, and frankly was mostly invisible during that time, garnering two defensive rebounds, committing two turnovers, and attempting zero field goals.</p><p>His Jazz teammates know he is trying to navigate how best to help the team without trying to force the action.

Obviously, you’re coming into this league, you’re playing against the best 400 players in the world,” said John Collins, who had 19 points on 9-for-10 shooting Saturday. “… Key obviously belongs in this league and belongs on the court. Really, it’s the mental grind for him.”</p><p>Sexton is making it a point to repeat the same message ad nauseum: Don’t compound mistakes with piled-on self-doubt, just trust in yourself and your teammates.</p><p>“That’s something that I keep telling him: ‘Yo, on to the next play. Continue to fight. We believe in you,’” said Sexton. “… The more you play, the more possessions, the more minutes you have, you’re going to start seeing your game elevate.”</p><p>Hardy knows that George is thinking entirely too much sometimes of late, rather than playing instinctually.</p><p>And he knows precisely why, too.</p><p>“I’ve said to him a lot: ‘You have a hard job as a lead guard, because I want you to shoot <i>and</i> pass on every play,’” Hardy said. “That’s just the way it goes.”</p><p>“He’s got it spot-on,” George conceded with a chagrined smile when told of the comment.</p><p>But that’s something he needs to get used to, his coach continued. Being in the second unit with noted gunner Jordan Clarkson <i>can’t</i> become an excuse to be deferential. Neither can being in the starting lineup alongside All-Star Lauri Markkanen, for that matter.</p><p>“He’s playing with good players. There’s no excuse,” said Hardy. “If you want to be on a good team, you’re going to play alongside other good players, and so he’s learning that now.”</p><p>And George is, indeed, learning.</p><p>Following that ineffectual stint before the break Saturday, something seemed to flip when he checked in with 4:29 left in the third quarter.</p><p>“I think today was, in the second half, one of my more aggressive games as far as getting downhill,” said George. “Everything’s starting to come back together.”</p><p>It began with a jab-step against Sixers star Tyrese Maxey on the perimeter, then utilizing a screen to fly down a wide-open lane. The ensuing slam at the 2:50 mark of the third was George’s first field-goal attempt of the game.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">nothing but room for take off 🛫<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TakeNote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TakeNote</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keyonte1george?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@keyonte1george</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jSmGHufRIa\">pic.twitter.com/jSmGHufRIa</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743820753160777980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>About a minute and a half later, he fired away from 3 and missed, but didn’t get any less aggressive.</p><p>A subsequent possession saw him swiftly move the ball, and he wound up with a hockey assist, as his pass to Ochai Agbaji was forwarded on to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/04/kelly-olynyk-his-wife-reunited/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Olynyk</a> for a made 3-pointer.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, he nicely executed the two-man game with Walker Kessler, taking a screen from the big man, occupying both Maxey and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2023/07/10/sixers-match-utah-jazzs-offer/\" target=\"_blank\">center Paul Reed</a>, and then feeding Kessler for a slam.</p><p>Later on, George got yet another screen from Kessler, this time on noted defender Patrick Beverley, and as he went around, he attacked the space between Nic Batum and Reed and didn’t hesitate to put up a midrange runner that dropped in.</p><p>Not quite 4 minutes into the fourth, another screen set him up to beat Maxey off dribble going left, after which he charged down the lane, drew multiple defenders, and flung a well-placed pass to Agbaji in the far corner for a 3-point try.</p><p>And a half-minute after that, he took a pass from Kessler and quickly moved it on to Markkanen in the other corner, this time for a made triple that put Utah up 105-91.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">pass<br />pass<br />catch &amp; 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘵 <a href=\"https://t.co/BhdvxtORXu\">pic.twitter.com/BhdvxtORXu</a></p>— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1743823069788201426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2024</a></blockquote><p>On this occasion, George said, it wasn’t a pep talk from any teammate or coach that got him to dial up the aggression.</p><p>“That was a conversation with myself, to be honest,” he said.</p><p>Hardy thought the timing was perfect considering the opponent, as he views Maxey’s progress as a blueprint for what’s possible with George.</p><p>A combo guard drafted in the middle of the first round, Maxey had to learn that same balance between when to defer to talented teammates such as Joel Embiid and James Harden, and when to exploit the scoring opportunities being presented to him.</p><p>And now, Maxey is having a transcendent breakthrough, averaging 25.9 points and 6.6 assists while shooting 37.4% from 3 as Philly’s No. 2 option behind the reigning MVP.</p><p>George is clearly a bit away from that right now.</p><p>But stringing together more and more moments like the ones he had in the second half against the Sixers could potentially get him there.</p><p>“We’re trying to just regain that aggressiveness when he’s on the floor that he had before he got injured. Right now I’m seeing a little bit of what we saw at the beginning of the year with him, where he has flashes of aggression but can also kind of fade back into the background a little bit. So it’s going to be a little bit of a work in progress,” said Hardy. “… He’s in a spot that I would anticipate — there’s nights where the balance is good, and there’s nights where he defers to the veteran guys. We’re trying to help him work through that, help him see the film and recognize that it’s OK to be aggressive when the game tells you to be aggressive.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Scott D.

Straight up,” Bistline told The Tribune. “Every facet of these extreme polygamous groups, there’s always children who are suffering. There’s always crimes against children.”</p><p>She makes that point quite forcefully in “Secrets of Polygamy,” which premieres Monday on A&amp;E. In addition to the FLDS, there are episodes that feature the Kingstons (aka The Order) and the Apostolic United Brethren.</p><p>Bistline — who grew up with three mothers and 27 siblings — didn’t exactly jump at the chance to appear in “Secrets.” She’s done interviews before, but this is her first time on TV, and she struggled with the decision because she knew it would, inevitably, involve her bringing members of her family into it.</p><p>“I was very scared about re-victimizing my little sisters and the women in my family,” Bistline said. “And also exploiting them, and telling their story without their permission.”</p><p>She eventually said yes to the show’s producers because she “started to get frustrated with the fact that my little sisters wouldn’t come forward” as witnesses in the case against Samuel Bateman. Followers told The Tribune in 2022 that Bateman <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2022/12/06/how-samuel-bateman-leader-new/\">lied to members</a> of the FLDS Church, telling them that <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=52354441&amp;itype=cmsid\">imprisoned FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs</a> is dead and that he is the new leader. Arrested in August 2022, Bateman is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/05/25/53-felonies-polygamist-leader/\">facing 51 felony charges</a> — including for sexually assaulting underage girls he took as “brides.”<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2022/12/06/how-samuel-bateman-leader-new/\"> </a></p><img alt=\"(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Samuel Bateman leaves the courthouse during the trial of Warren Jeffs in St. George on Sept. 14, 2007.

Bateman was present as an observer and supporter of Jeffs. (Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>Most of Bistline’s family, she said, is following Bateman. Bistline said her older brother gave his underage daughters — one just 12 years old — to Bateman as wives. (The brother was arrested last May, and other members of Bistline’s family are also facing charges.)</p><p>Bistline is in the first of 10 episodes of “Secrets of Polygamy,”, which airs Monday on A&amp;E — 8 p.m. on Dish and DirecTV; 11 p.m. on Comcast. She agreed to be interviewed, she said, when she “started to realize” her sisters wouldn’t come forward “because they didn’t have an example in their life of someone doing that. I decided to speak out to be an example.”</p><p>As she explains in the program, Bistline left the FLDS Church in 2011, when she was 19. She said she felt there was “more than this” to life and she didn’t want “to be stuck in a marriage where I was just one of multiple women and I don’t have an identity. And my only purpose in life is to have children. … That can be a great purpose. But if that’s chosen for me, it feels like I’m an object.”</p><p>And entering the world outside the church “was a culture shock, for sure.” She not only recalls wearing a bikini for the first time, but has vivid memories of when she began wearing pants. “I would catch myself in the mirror and just, like, shock myself, because I had legs,” she said with a laugh. “I mean, I don’t want to say it wasn’t hard, because I was missing my family a lot. But it was very exciting.”</p><img alt=\"Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune\\n\\nHandcuffed and flanked by Las Vegas Metro PD Swat officers, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs appeared before Judge James M.

(Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>Bistline went to college, got a nursing degree, and “nursing became my new identity.” But now Bateman “has entered the chat.”</p><p>“There was a period of years between when I left and when Sam Bateman took over my family that I felt pretty normal,” Bistline said. “I went years trying to shove it away. I wanted to be known for my career and my brain. And then when all of this started happening with Sam Bateman, I had a realization that there’s … not a greater cause than to fight for children who are stuck in situations like this.”</p><p>“Secrets” isn’t the first documentary or series about polygamy, and it’s not chock full of secrets. Most of it will only be new to those who haven’t paid much attention. It’s in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2022/06/06/scott-d-pierce-netflix/\">“Keep Sweet”</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2015/07/14/in-new-utah-set-reality-show-former-kingston-women-reveal-the-oppressive-abusive-side-of-polygamy/\">“Escaping Polygamy”</a> — it’s not one of those so-called reality shows like <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51379403&amp;itype=CMSID\">“Sister Wives,”</a> which quickly devolved into unintended comedy.</p><p>It’s a serious story, complete with ominous music and a straightforward narrative that is a bit flat. If you’re already interested in the subject of polygamy, it will be of interest to you. And, judging by the number of shows and documentaries about polygamy, there are plenty of people who are interested. Exactly why is hard to say, even for a former member of the FLDS Church.</p><p>“This is my life. It’s hard for me to step outside and see what the fascination is,” Bistline said. “I don’t know what it’s like to have just a two-parent household.”</p><p>But she has come to some conclusions about the FLDS Church, the people who remain in it and the people who’ve escaped.</p><p>“Growing up, I was always told that anyone who leaves regrets it and they always want to come back,” Bistline said. “And in my brain, I thought, ‘Oh, they can’t survive without the religion. They need the religion because they need a purpose.’</p><p>“But once I left, I realized, ‘Oh my God, it’s not the religion that they need — it’s their family.’ That’s the hard part.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

Who don’t speak English.</p><p>(One <a href=\"https://www.lingualinx.com/case-studies/salt-lake-city-public-schools\" target=\"_blank\">survey indicates</a> there are more than 100 different languages spoken by students in the Salt Lake City School District alone.)</p><p>The agricultural/industrial era of leaving school in the eighth grade and making a good living is over. The days of Utah as a land of uniformity, where the schools could “Stack ‘em deep and teach ‘em cheap” are gone for good.</p><p>We must guard against the deliberate undermining of our public education system as some lawmakers look for more ways to divert revenue from the state income tax, once devoted by the state Constitution to education and education alone, to other uses.</p><p>And as legislators and other activists push to expand a taxpayer-funded voucher system for private and home schooling. A system that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/07/26/misleading-website-invites-utahns/\" target=\"_blank\">hasn’t even enrolled its first student</a> yet.</p><p>The Utah Fits All Scholarship, created and endowed with $42.5 million by the Legislature in its 2023 session, ponies up enough to offer $8,000 to each of 5,000 students whose families are seeking alternatives to public and charter schools. And to have the taxpayer share in the cost, even as the state has no way to look to see if the schooling provided is worth the cost.</p><p>This is a lack of oversight no lawmaker should or would tolerate for public schools or other public agencies. Yet, for this side hustle, a lack of accountability is not a bug, it’s a feature.</p><p>As others have pointed out, it sounds far too much like offering state money to families that are already relatively affluent so they can send their children to elite country clubs and athletic facilities because public parks and rec centers just aren’t good enough for them.</p><p>This semester, er, legislative session begins Jan. 16. <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Be aware</a>.

The war, said Ben-Gvir, presents an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza,” facilitating Israeli settlement in the region.</p><p>The Biden administration has joined countries all over the world in condemning these naked endorsements of ethnic cleansing. But in doing so, it acted as if Ben-Gvir and Smotrich’s provocations are fundamentally at odds with the worldview of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to whom America continues to give unconditional backing. In a statement denouncing the ministers’ words as “inflammatory and irresponsible,” the State Department said, “We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the government of Israel, including by the prime minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government.”</p><p>Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat who has called for a cease-fire, thanked the State Department in a social media post, saying, “It must be clear that America will not write a blank check for mass displacement.”</p><p>But it’s not clear, because we’re writing a blank check to a government whose leader is only a bit more coy than Ben-Gvir and Smotrich about his intentions for Gaza. As Israeli news outlets have reported, Netanyahu said this week that the government is considering a “scenario of surrender and deportation” of residents of the Gaza Strip. According to a Times of Israel article, “The ‘voluntary’ resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza is slowly becoming a key official policy of the government, with a senior official saying that Israel has held talks with several countries for their potential absorption.”</p><p>Some in Israel’s government have denied this, mostly on grounds of impracticality. “It’s a baseless illusion, in my opinion: No country will absorb 2 million people, or 1 million, or 100,000, or 5,000,” one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Israeli journalists. And on Thursday, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, released a plan for the day after the war that said that, contrary to the dreams of the ultranationalists, there would be no Israeli settlement in Gaza.</p><p>But with its widespread destruction of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, including roughly 70% of its housing, Israel is making most of Gaza uninhabitable for the foreseeable future. Disease is rampant in Gaza, hunger almost universal, and the United Nations reports that much of the enclave is at risk of famine. Amid all this horror, members of Netanyahu’s Likud party — such as Danny Danon, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations, and Gila Gamliel, Israel’s intelligence minister — are pushing emigration as a humanitarian solution.</p><p>“Instead of funneling money to rebuild Gaza or to the failed UNRWA,” the United Nations agency that works with Palestinian refugees, “the international community can assist in the costs of resettlement, helping the people of Gaza build new lives in their new host countries,” wrote Gamliel in The Jerusalem Post.</p><p>Right now, this is a grotesque fantasy. But as Gaza’s suffering ratchets up, some sort of evacuation might come to appear to be a necessary last resort. At least, that’s what some prominent Israeli officials seem to be counting on.</p><p>After Hamas’ sadistic attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Israel was justified in retaliating; any country would have. But there is a difference between the war Israel’s liberal supporters want to pretend that the country is fighting in Gaza, and the war Israel is actually waging.</p><p>Pro-Israel Democrats want to back a war to remove Hamas from Gaza. But increasingly, it looks as if America is underwriting a war to remove <i>Gazans</i> from Gaza. Experts in international law can debate whether the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza can be classified as genocidal, as South Africa is claiming at the International Court of Justice, or as some lesser type of war crime. But whatever you want to call attempts to “thin out” Gaza’s population — as the Hebrew newspaper Israel Hayom described an alleged Netanyahu proposal — the United States is implicated in them.</p><p>By acting as if Ben-Gvir and Smotrich can be hived off from the government in which they serve, U.S. policymakers are fostering denial about the character of Netanyahu’s rule. Joe Biden often speaks of his 1973 meeting with Golda Meir, then the prime minister, and like many American Zionists, his view of Israel sometimes seems stuck in that era.</p><p>If you grew up in a liberal Zionist household, as I did, you’ve probably heard this (possibly apocryphal) Meir quote: “When peace comes we will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” There’s much to criticize in this sentiment — its self-regard, the way it positions Israel as the victim even when it’s doing the killing; still, it at least suggests a tortured ambivalence about meting out violence. But this attitude, which Israelis sometimes call “shooting and crying,” is now as obsolete as Meir’s Zionist socialism, at least among Israel’s leaders.</p><p>Among both American and European politicians, said my friend Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator with the Palestinians who now heads the U.S./Middle East Project, there’s a “willful refusal to take seriously just how extreme this government is — whether before Oct. 7 or subsequently.” I’m tempted to say that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich said the quiet part out loud, but in truth they just said the loud part louder.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/opinion/israel-gaza-displacement.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: Before casting your vote for president, remember who called military personnel “suckers” and “losers”',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Letter: Before casting your vote for president, remember who called military personnel “suckers” and “losers”'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-before-casting-your-vote/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum'}],\n   'author': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Larry Eldracher | The Public Forum'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:01 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Within a month after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, my 19-year-old father enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.

The same way I was raised — to feed. To overfeed. We were brought up to prepare food not for what will be, but for what could be. To embody the physical manifestation of Jesus’ <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/new-testament-stories/chapter-28-jesus-feeds-5000-people?lang=eng\">miracle with the loaves and fishes</a>.

The spirits of my ancestors entered my body and used my hands to peel 20 pounds of potatoes and boil a dozen eggs. I have not even a whiff of a memory of any of this. I remember only the outcome.</p><p>“I don’t know what happened,” I told my husband as we stood over our two largest bowls, each heaped with enough bland potato salad to feed 20 families at a potluck in a Pleasant Grove meetinghouse.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>I know I’ve always been this way, but I don’t think I understood there was something wrong with me until I visited my husband’s family in Washington for the first time and attended a dinner at his sister’s house.</p><p>“How is such an offering meant to feed this many people?” I whispered to my husband as his sister pulled from the oven a sparse roasting pan of 12 asparagus spears and presented them to the 15 people in attendance.</p><p>“May the Lord sustain us in the coming months after suffering this season’s destitute harvest,” I mumbled in despair upon surveying the platter of five divided chicken breasts.

They ate. They then stood up and cleaned the empty modest receptacles. No waste. No leftovers. I believe leftovers were never anticipated.

Maybe it’s because, unlike many other families, ours haven’t historically chugged <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/09/23/what-is-lds-word-wisdom/\">wine with dinner</a>, so we turned to an overindulgence in food as our vice of choice. Maybe this behavior is the result of residual cultural trauma from our ancestors’ brutal pioneer treks across the Plains. Maybe there’s a little genetic part of us that still thinks we all belong to large polygamous families. Maybe it’s a dash of all those things.</p><p>But even if genetics can contribute, I did recently learn environmental factors may be just as culpable a cause in some.</p><p>A few months ago, my husband and I hosted a small neighborhood gathering in our backyard.

In response, Trump has asked the Supreme Court to intervene on his behalf in the Colorado case, and he has appealed Maine’s decision.</p><p>There is a real question of whether this attempt to protect American democracy — by removing a would-be authoritarian from the ballot — is itself a threat to American democracy. Will proponents and supporters of the 14th Amendment option effectively destroy the village in order to save it?</p><p>It may seem obvious, but we should remember that Trump is not an ordinary political figure. And try as some commentators might, there is no amount of smoke one could create — through strained counterfactuals, dire warnings of a slippery slope or outright dismissal of the events that make the Trump of 2024 a figure very different from the Trump of 2020 — that can obscure or occlude this basic fact.</p><p>In 2020, Trump went to the voting public of the United States and asked for another four years in office. By 51% to 47%, the voting public of the United States said no<i>.</i> More importantly, Trump lost the Electoral College, 306-232, meaning there were enough of those voters in just the right states to deny him a second term.</p><p>The people decided. And Trump said, in so many words, that he didn’t care. What followed, according to the final report of the House select committee on Jan. 6, was an effort to overturn the result of the election.</p><p>Trump, the committee wrote, “unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.” He “oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.” He “summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6,” the day Congress was slated to certify the election results, and “instructed them to march to the Capitol” so that they could “‘take back’ their country.’” He even sent a message on Twitter attacking his vice president, Mike Pence, knowing full well that “a violent attack on the Capitol was underway.”</p><p>In the face of this violence, Trump “refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television.” He did not deploy the National Guard, nor did he “instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist.”</p><p>Trump sought and actively tried to subvert constitutional government and overturn the results of the presidential election. And what he could not do through the arcane rules and procedures of the Electoral College, he tried to do through the threat of brute force, carried out by an actual mob.</p><p>Looked at this way, the case for disqualifying Trump through the 14th Amendment is straightforward. Section 3 states that “No person shall ... hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”</p><p>As the legal scholar Mark A. Graber writes in an amicus brief submitted to the Colorado Supreme Court, “American jurists understood an insurrection against the United States to be an attempt by two or more persons for public reasons to obstruct by force or intimidation the implementation of federal law.” There was also a legal consensus at the time of the amendment’s drafting and ratification that an individual “engaged in insurrection whenever they knowingly incited, assisted or otherwise participated in an insurrection.”</p><p>We also know that the framers of the 14th Amendment did not aim or intend to exclude the president of the United States from its terms. In 1870, the Republican-controlled Senate refused to seat Zebulon Vance, the former Confederate governor of North Carolina. It strains credulity to think that the same Republicans would have sat silent if the Democratic Party had, in 1872, nominated a former Confederate leader for the presidency.</p><p>Under a plain reading of Section 3 — and given the evidence uncovered by the Jan. 6 committee — Trump cannot stand for the presidency of the United States or any other federal office, for that matter.</p><p>The real issue with disqualifying Trump is less constitutional than political. Disqualification, goes the argument, would bring American democracy to the breaking point.</p><p>In this line of thinking, to deny Americans their choice of presidential candidate would destroy any remaining confidence in the American political system. It would also invite Trump’s allies in the Republican Party to do the same to Democrats, weaponizing Section 3 and disqualifying candidates for any number of reasons. Disqualification would also give far more power to the courts when the only appropriate venue for the question of Trump is the voting booth.</p><p>But these objections rest on a poor foundation. They treat Trump as an ordinary candidate and Jan. 6 as a variation on ordinary politics. But as the House select committee established, Jan. 6 and the events leading up to it were nothing of the sort. And while many Americans still contest the meaning of the attack on the Capitol, many Americans also contested, in the wake of the Civil War, the meaning of secession and rebellion. That those Americans viewed Confederate military and political leaders as heroes did not somehow delegitimize the Republican effort to keep them, as much as possible, out of formal political life.</p><p>What unites Trump with the former secessionists under the disqualification clause is that, like them, he refused to listen to the voice of the voting public. He rejected the bedrock principle of democratic life: the peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>The unspoken assumption behind the idea that Trump should be allowed on the ballot and that the public should have the chance to choose for or against him yet again is that he will respect the voice of the electorate. But we know this isn’t true. It wasn’t true after the 2016 presidential election — when, after winning the Electoral College, he sought to delegitimize the popular vote victory of his opponent as fraud — and it was put into stark relief after the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Trump is not simply a candidate who does not believe in the norms, values and institutions we call American democracy — although that is troubling enough. Trump is all that and a former president who used the power of his office to try to overturn constitutional government in the United States.</p><p>Is it anti-democratic to disqualify Trump from office and deny him a place on the ballot? Does it violate the spirit of democratic life to deny voters the choice of a onetime officeholder who tried, under threat of violence, to deny them their right to choose? Does it threaten the constitutional order to use the clear text of the Constitution to hold a former constitutional officer accountable for his efforts to overturn that order?</p><p>The answer is no, of course not. There is no rule that says democracies must give endless and unlimited grace to those who used the public trust to conspire, for all the world to see, against them. Voters are free to choose a Republican candidate for president; they are free to choose a Republican with Trump’s politics. But if we take the Constitution seriously, then Trump, by dint of his own actions, should be off the board.</p><p>Not that he will be. The best odds are that the Supreme Court of the United States will punt the issue of Section 3 in a way that allows Trump to run on every ballot in every state. And while it will be tempting to attribute this outcome to the ideological composition of the court — as well as the fact that Trump appointed three of its nine members — I think it will, if it happens, have as much to do with the zone of exception that exists around the former president.</p><p>If Trump has a political superpower, it’s that other people believe he has political superpowers. They believe that any effort to hold him accountable will backfire. They believe that he will always ride a wave of backlash to victory. They believe that challenging him on anything other than his terms will leave him stronger than ever.</p><p>Most of this is false. But to the extent that it is true, it has less to do with the missed shots — to borrow an aphorism from professional sports — than it does with the ones not taken in the first place.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/opinion/trump-insurrections-disqualification-14th-amendment.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: Let’s take the inland port off the back burner and savor the full picture',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Letter: Let’s take the inland port off the back burner and savor the full picture'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-lets-take-inland-port-off/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-lets-take-inland-port-off/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-lets-take-inland-port-off/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Thomas Walker | The Public Forum'}],\n   'author': 'Thomas Walker | The Public Forum',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Thomas Walker | The Public Forum'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:01 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Could the inland port development please be accelerated somehow?</p><p>This afternoon I can still see the Oquirrhs from my home.

We married in Utah seven years ago and recently welcomed two amazing children into our lives; we’ve been spending time these past few weeks reflecting on Utah’s evolution on LGBTQ+ people.</p><p>We’ve come so far since the 2004 passage of Amendment 3 — the constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from marrying passed with 65% support. Polling now shows a complete reversal, with one tracking 72% of Utahns supporting marriage for same-sex couples. Strikingly, leaders in the state have evolved, too: Gov. Spencer Cox has spoken movingly about dignity for LGBTQ+ people, and before him, Gov. Jon Huntsman was an early Republican to express support for marriage equality. Just last year Mitt Romney was one of 12 <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/11/29/23484230/respect-for-marriage-act-mike-lee-amendment-mitt-romney-vote\">Republican senators</a> to approve the Respect for Marriage Act, which will protect marriages like ours no matter what happens at the U.S. Supreme Court in the years ahead.</p><p>If the Supreme Court were to take up a challenge to same-sex couples’ freedom to marry, they’d be wise to look at Utah and how much we’ve changed. Even the LDS Church, once one of the most powerful opponents of the freedom to marry, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/religion-relationships-gay-rights-utah-07847f4b7e3e96d81c10a298a199b860\">voiced support</a> for the Respect for Marriage Act.</p><p>That’s not to say there’s no work ahead: The passage of anti-transgender laws in Utah was a heartbreaking part of 2023, and we must continue pushing forward. But the 10-year anniversary of the freedom to marry is a good reminder to always speak out for dignity and equality — because change and growth are possible.</p><p><i>Jason Myers and Brian Nicholls, Salt Lake City</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/09/08/how-share-your-opinion-with-salt/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Submit a letter to the editor</i></a></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Letter: What will it take for Utahns to open their hearts and accept diversity?',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'Letter: What will it take for Utahns to open their hearts and accept diversity?'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2024/01/07/letter-what-will-it-take-utahns/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum'}],\n   'author': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Maurena Grossman | The Public Forum'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 13:00:01 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': '',\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': ''},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs around the country are being shut down.

The debacle’s architects promise to make America’s elite institutions great again. They say they pushed out Gay and, nearly a month ago, the University of Pennsylvania’s president as a warning to the nation’s cultural institutions. How they will continue to wield their influence and if they will succeed depends on how willing we all are to keep buying age-old ideas about merit from power-hungry peddlers.</p><p>Gay’s resignation comes nearly a month after she, along with the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania, testified before Congress. (Columbia University was also invited. It declined. As the kids say, Columbia understood the assignment.) These particular schools were chosen not because of their academic bona fides but because of their cultural significance. Yes, Harvard, Penn and MIT boast highly selective admissions and lauded faculty. But they are also institutions with strong international brands built on prestige, history and the perception of excellence. A hearing ostensibly about antisemitism on campus quickly became little more than a coordinated political spectacle about power.</p><p>You do not have to take my word for it. You can believe Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who was one of the architects of the debacle, who celebrated on X, formerly Twitter, this week for having “SCALPED” Gay. Distinct from the campaign waged against Penn’s former president Elizabeth Magill, the attacks against Gay have been cut from whole cloth, from a historical narrative about merit and diversity that is a hallmark of America’s higher-education prestige hierarchy.</p><p>Rufo explained his plan for ginning up controversy about higher education’s most prestigious universities in an interview on the heels of Gay’s resignation, explaining that it was a coordinated, strategic attack that used narrative, financial and political leverage. His partners included members of Congress, wealthy donors, journalists, media and a bloodthirsty audience. Riding high on success, Rufo said his strategy could push the conservative movement back into what he considers its rightful place: the top of America’s most powerful cultural institutions.</p><p>The three legs of Rufo’s strategic stool are basic organizing tools — creating a message, attracting financial patronage and forging political alliances. It is notable that he can pull these levers. But that may say more about our times than about Rufo himself. The financial donors who wanted to exert control had the money and political will. The politicians have been freed from the shackles of voters who would penalize them for bad behavior. If there is any real strategy at work here, it is the message the Rufo team created. He gives credit to conservative journalists like Christopher Brunet and Aaron Sibirium. The message interpolates several old tropes into a liberal-sounding message about merit.</p><p>Rufo says he smuggled a narrative into “the left-wing media.” That narrative rests on a critical discursive link — DEI is synonymous with “lacking merit.” It is a neat trick. Harvard’s endowment has been valued at nearly $50 billion. Yet, the Rufo messaging strategy successfully painted the institution’s president as an undeserving beneficiary, even if she is not.</p><p>The specter of DEI made her presidency sound like a voucher program for a welfare recipient and not the internal promotion of a long-term employee to leadership. When you hear someone from the reactionary crowd talk about DEI’s undue influence over an institution like Harvard, he sounds like a royal who finds himself forced to go to the DMV for the first time. Subjected to rules designed for hoi polloi, forced into lines with people who need the government and unable to buy his way out of it. It is not genius. It is a powerful rhetorical strategy because it merged the political craftsmanship of the 1988 Willie Horton ad with the moralism of federalism.</p><p>It plays on the latent but powerful idea that government — big government — unfairly helps undeserving people, many of them women and people of color, who drain the pool of opportunity for deserving people. DEI is “bad” because it supplants merit for diversity and it empowers the racialized federal government to stick its hands into an institution that produces the cultural elite. That made Harvard a <i>public problem</i>. The public proved all too willing to weigh in on whether a tenured professor deserved her job, with its role, status and ranking. Once this link was secured, every other charge became stickier.</p><p>Rufo wants to be certain that he gets credit. That is a lot of ego talking, but he may have a point. Despite his broadcasting his plans on X, laying out his strategy like a cartoon villain and claiming victory to anyone who will listen, some people still want to find more genteel explanations. Conservative commentators blame diversity itself for the Harvard debacle, arguing that a “social justice model” of higher education has supplanted a merit model at our nation’s colleges and universities. It is most galling at the most prestigious institutions, where status granted without concern for merit breeds resentment. Consequently, academic rigor and culture have receded from Western civilization’s high-water mark.</p><p>It is a popular idea. Some scholars believe it. A lot of the alt-right believes it. Regular people complaining about someone getting into college when they did not “deserve” to believe it. The underlying belief is noxious. It presumes diversity and merit are mutually exclusive. Beyond that, whether higher education is less meritorious now than it was in some unspecified past cannot be measured.</p><p>That is because merit, itself, cannot be defined. That is why the concept is so useful for slippery slopes. It cannot be proved or disproved. It can only be argued.</p><p>Academicians and practitioners know that you cannot operationalize merit. But historians know that there is powerful evidence about merit in the archives of our nation’s elite institutions. Whenever politicians, activists and investors agree that there is a merit crisis at Harvard, it signals that a battle rages, not over rigor, but over power.</p><p>In the 1880s, Harvard was willing to train a small group of women in art, literature and philosophy. But there were limits. Class and race, obviously. But also a limit on just how legitimate this training was when pursued by the female sex. Some worried that educating women could corrupt their natural talents and that coeducational learning could compromise character development for men and women.</p><p>In the 1920s, Harvard (along with Yale and Princeton) were dismayed that so many Jewish students were passing its carefully designed admissions tests. The institutions set out to revise those tests to account for all manner of cultural and physical attributes to filter out those Jewish students. The tests included questions about “character” that amounted to a litmus test for race and ethnicity. Jerome Karabel, in his book “The Chosen,” shows this redefinition of merit at Harvard, Yale and Princeton over and over again as elite institutions fight not to defend rigor but to maintain their hold on status amid social changes in America.</p><p>Wave after wave of immigrants, minorities and other socially mobile groups of people in the United States have experienced a similar story with Harvard. Each successive fight for the university’s soul was cloaked in language about merit. Well-meaning scolds worried about immigrants’ test scores or poor students’ cultural fit or whether women could do math. Every time, the moral case for “diversity” must contend with the supposedly rational case for “merit” or achievement. There are often religious overtones, harking back to America’s manifest destiny; it’s as if the country will dissolve into a failed state if merit’s clerics do not defend its virtues.</p><p>All of this dichotomous thinking forgets one thing: Academics are not born; they’re made. More broadly, administrators of Harvard, or anywhere else for that matter, are not born; they are made. They are promoted and trained. Surely, Harvard can train a bureaucrat.</p><p>Of course Harvard can train a bureaucrat. It trains the world’s leaders. It also runs the Harvard Seminar for New Presidents, which trains university presidents. It is part of academic leadership culture and the administrative industry that has grown around higher education.</p><p>What I have found particularly interesting (if not a little shocking) about this whole affair is that Gay’s promotion to president is so utterly <i>normal</i>. Rufo has described her scholarship record as “thin,” but university leadership has been professionalized for at least two decades. Competitive programs recruit and train cohorts of early-career scholars to prepare them to become provosts and presidents. Beyond that, “nontraditional” university presidents are highly prized in the modern university. University boards view them as market-friendly and business-savvy.</p><p>As has happened historically, Gay’s detractors redefined merit to mean whatever they wanted it to mean, in practice turning bureaucratic minutiae into a political bomb. Joseph McCarthy could only have wished for the networked media power that today’s reactionary power-seekers possess. The speed, scale and amplification of the power to capture an aspect of routine workaday life and cast it as nefarious activity is staggering. What has happened at Harvard is not just a blueprint for taking over higher education; it is a strategy for taking over our information environment.</p><p>I don’t like to argue about the human resources problems of rich private colleges. But love them or hate them, the Ivies set the Overton window for a lot of higher education. Colleges without Harvard’s media spotlight and billions of dollars are more vulnerable. Countless mobilized reactionary groups have more media attention than they have organic audience. They know how to capture media, court financial donors and form political alliances. They do not need a wide community of adherents to make themselves look like a movement.</p><p>If you like Rufo’s vision of a status hierarchy, in which merit is whatever the winner says it is, then he’s your man. In his vision for the New College of Florida, liberal arts has been diminished, gender studies has been marginalized and merit — whatever that means — trumps social justice. Harvard can buttress the consequences with prestige and money. The rest of higher education will find it harder. Networked, nationalized and emboldened, Rufo has nothing standing in his way. If Florida feels like the future you desire, you are in luck. Florida’s architects are winning.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared in </i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/opinion/claudine-gay-resignation-harvard.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'Shurtleff, Swallow and now Reyes.

Early on, Reyes dismissed Ballard’s critics as “haters,” but last month, while announcing that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/07/ag-sean-reyes-wont-run-reelection/\">he would not seek reelection</a> this year, the attorney general said he now believes the accusers and that his office is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2023/12/08/ag-sean-reyes-launches-criminal/\">launching a criminal investigation of Ballard and OUR</a>.</p><p>Additional reporting has highlighted <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2023/11/12/luxury-resorts-texas-hog-hunt-how/\">at least 30 trips Reyes took, many to luxury resorts</a> in Europe, Mexico and the United States, paid for with campaign donations, as well as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/10/27/utah-attorney-general-sean-reyes/\">partnerships his nonprofit Liberate All Value All Foundation claimed to have</a> with various charities — despite most of them never having received any support from Reyes’ <a href=\"https://golava.org/\">LAVA Foundation</a>.</p><p>In November, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/11/14/utah-ag-sean-reyes-office-be/\">legislative leaders launched a sweeping audit</a> of the management, decision-making and travel policy in the attorney general’s office that is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2023/11/17/audit-utah-ag-sean-reyess-office/\">due out later this year</a>. And lawyers for the state are in court arguing that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2023/12/19/sean-reyes-calendars-should-not-be/\">his official calendar should not be made public</a> under Utah’s open records law.</p><p>The recurring turmoil has lawmakers hoping that the audit points to possible fixes to prevent the stain of scandal from reinfecting the Utah attorney general’s office.</p><p>“We obviously have got something going on inside the A.G.’s office that continues to invite corruption,” Democratic Rep.

(Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>A ‘for sale’ sign on the office door</p><p>The scandal that engulfed Shurtleff and Swallow was years in the making. It began to unravel days after Shurtleff handed over the reins to Swallow, his hand-picked successor. In <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=24883333&amp;itype=storyID\">January 2013</a>, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Swallow had huddled the previous spring at an Orem Krispy Kreme shop with Jeremy Johnson, who was under a federal indictment at the time.</p><p>Johnson and a business partner <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=24883333&amp;itype=storyID\">had paid Swallow $250,000 in an effort to persuade then-U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to intervene and stave off the federal charges</a>. Johnson characterized the money as a payoff; Swallow insisted it was for lobbying. Either way, it hadn’t worked, and now Johnson and a partner wanted the money back.</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55717936&amp;itype=cmsid\">Johnson had secretly taped the meeting</a> as the two men talked about money that had changed hands, alleged payments to Reid to back the online poker industry, Swallow wondering if he was under investigation, and Johnson advising him to buy a burner phone — which he later did.</p><p>Other questions soon arose.</p><p>Evidence emerged that Swallow and Shurtleff had taken gifts from Johnson — use of his private jet, stays in Johnson’s lavish St. George homes and <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55734633&amp;itype=cmsid\">Swallow’s use of Johnson’s Lake Powell houseboat</a>, complete with a helipad — in exchange for their support in receiving a legal opinion from the attorney general’s office that would enable Johnson and his partners to <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55834555&amp;itype=CMSID\">process online poker transactions</a>, a potentially lucrative business.</p><p>Swallow and Shurtleff were also accused by a then-jailed businessman, Marc Sessions Jenson, of <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56282825&amp;itype=CMSID\">pressuring him into providing them ritzy stays at his resort home</a> in Newport Beach, Calif., and other gifts at a time the businessman was under the supervision of the attorney general’s office pursuant to a plea deal that Shurtleff had allegedly negotiated.</p><p>As the revelations rolled out, a series of investigations came to life. The <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56292844&amp;itype=CMSID\">lieutenant governor’s office hired a law firm to investigate potential campaign finance violations</a>. The Legislature — as it has done with Reyes — <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56566800&amp;itype=CMSID\">initiated a pair of audits</a>. The FBI, along with prosecutors in Davis and Salt Lake counties, ramped up criminal inquiries.</p><p>In the Utah House, Republicans debated whether to launch an impeachment inquiry or whether to wait and see what federal agents uncovered.</p><p>Spencer Cox, then a freshman representative just a few months in office, spoke passionately, assailing his colleagues resisting a House investigation of “shirking” their responsibility. The House should fulfill its constitutional duty, he prodded, not rely on the loathed federal government.</p><p>“I’m embarrassed by members of our own body who rail against the federal government and then plead for us to wait for the now suddenly brilliant Federal Bureau of Investigation to do our constitutional responsibility,” Cox chided. “I’ll be damned if I’m going to let them restore the public trust.”</p><p>A few months later, <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56974682&amp;itype=CMSID\">then-Gov. Gary Herbert chose Cox to be his new lieutenant governor</a>, positioning him to be the state’s next governor.</p><p>The House ended up taking a middle track, creating a House Special Investigative Committee and hiring an outside counsel and investigators to delve into the allegations.</p><p>Well before the committee finished its work, though, Swallow was gone, <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57163170&amp;itype=cmsid\">resigning on the eve</a> of the release of the lieutenant governor’s investigation, which cited numerous violations of campaign finance law.</p><img alt=\"(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Special counsels Steve Ross and Steve Reich wait for the House Special Investigative Committee to begin its meeting looking into the allegations against then-Attorney General John Swallow on Nov. 5, 2013, at the Capitol in Salt Lake City.\" height=\"2293\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/41YNbQ3GDiwBItErfbk411yRIMs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/EJPS5WFCA5AVJB5NRMGZKHDBEI.jpeg\" width=\"2900\" /><br /><caption>(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Special counsels Steve Ross and Steve Reich wait for the House Special Investigative Committee to begin its meeting looking into the allegations against then-Attorney General John Swallow on Nov. 5, 2013, at the Capitol in Salt Lake City.

But make no mistake: It will begin today.”</p><p>The following March, the House committee presented its findings on Reyes’ predecessors: “The committee concluded that Mr. Swallow hung a <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57671084&amp;itype=cmsid\">veritable ‘for sale’ sign</a> on the office door that invited moneyed interests to seek special treatment and favors.”</p><p>The committee’s work verified that Swallow had worked to help Johnson’s poker interests while receiving gifts and that Swallow had <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57290573&amp;itype=CMSID\">secretly promised to support the payday lending industry in exchange for campaign donations</a> and created a network of entities to hide the money.</p><p>It also detailed how Shurtleff had worked with Swallow to <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58188015&amp;itype=CMSID\">negotiate a deal with Bank of America to avoid the bank foreclosing on the home of a Swallow campaign donor</a>. Shurtleff, on his last days in office, ignored his staff attorneys and dismissed a lawsuit brought against Bank of America on behalf of Utah homeowners, then landed a job with the law firm representing the bank.</p><p>The House panel also found that Swallow had <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57285758&amp;itype=CMSID\">fabricated documents</a> in an attempt to create a legitimate paper trail for certain transactions and had lost a suspicious amount of data — deleting emails and calendar entries, wiping computer hard drives, and <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57087128&amp;itype=CMSID\">losing or damaging a series of cellphones, iPads and his home computer</a>.</p><p>Four months later, both <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58185969&amp;itype=CMSID\">Shurtleff and Swallow were charged with a host of felonies</a>, surrendered to authorities and were booked, fingerprinted and released.

Swallow <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/03/19/former-utah-attorney/\">challenged Reyes for the Republican nomination in 2020</a>, partly criticizing Reyes’ focus on trafficking overseas as a distraction from his duties as attorney general. Swallow lost.</p><p>What reforms may be needed?</p><p>Now Reyes finds himself facing a measure of the scrutiny his predecessors endured — minus allegations of criminal misconduct — and is <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/07/ag-sean-reyes-wont-run-reelection/\">stepping down after his current term expires in January 2025</a>.</p><p>Going forward, though, a big question has become whether structural changes are needed to avoid another repeat of the problems in the future.</p><p>Chris Toth, who spent 18 years on the staff of the National Association of Attorneys General, said it begins with the individual — someone who is committed to public service, adheres to strict ethical standards and instills that culture throughout the office.</p><p>That has grown more challenging. As attorneys general have become more powerful and the amount of money spent trying to influence them has mushroomed, Toth said that requires candidates to rigorously vet who is giving them money.</p><p>“Generally, if you’re getting involved in lobbying an A.G.,” he said, “there is bad conduct that has occurred or bad conduct that is percolating somewhere.”</p><p>In addition, groups like the Republican Attorneys General Association, its Democratic counterpart, and the Attorney General Alliance have, in recent decades, made it easier for entities that want to spend millions to influence the attorneys general, he said. Often that money is not reported.</p><p>Reyes currently chairs RAGA, which is also by far his biggest campaign donor — funneling nearly $450,000 to his campaign since 2014. And last year, the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/2022/12/01/qatar-paid-utah-ag-sean-reyes/\">government of Qatar paid to send Reyes</a> to the 2022 World Cup with funds channeled through AGA.</p><p>The Swallow investigative committee compiled a series of “suggestions” of policies to address issues arising from that scandal — including a series of changes to campaign finance laws.</p><p>Having a law enforcement official raising large amounts of money creates the potential for conflicts of interest, and Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, who served on the Swallow investigative panel, said it’s worth reexamining those rules.</p><p>One already enacted post-Swallow reform was the creation of an ethics commission for executive offices — governor, attorney general, treasurer and auditor. The Tribune reported last year, however, that<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/01/11/commission-investigate-unethical/\"> the five-member commission had seen long vacancies in several seats</a>, handled its last complaint in 2021, and had an out-of-order hotline.</p><p>Jeff Merchant, executive director of the progressive group Alliance for a Better Utah, said he would like to see an inspector general established with investigative authority over those offices.</p><p>“If we just have the Legislature doing it, I’m sorry, they have an inherent conflict of interest. When it’s Republicans from the top down, there’s some incentive not to rat each other out,” he said. “We need to have somebody who is somewhat independent looking over what it is that these people who have immense amounts of power are doing [and] keeping them in check.”</p><img alt=\"(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Sen.

Michael McKell, R-Spanish Fork, talks with Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City in February 2023. (Leah Hogsten/)</caption><p>Which is best: elected or appointed?</p><p>The proposed change that has received the most attention is McKell’s push to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/10/12/utah-ag-sean-reyes-relationship/\">change the Utah Constitution to give the governor the authority to hire — and fire — the attorney general</a>. It’s a power given to the nation’s president but a rarity at the state level.</p><p>Forty-three <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/attorneys-general/\">states elect their attorneys general</a>; five have the office appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. In Maine, the attorney general is chosen by the Legislature, and, in Tennessee, the attorney general is appointed by the state’s Supreme Court and confirmed by the Legislature.</p><p>McKell is not the first to explore the appointment route. In the mid-1990s, Utah’s Constitutional Revision Commission recommended appointing the attorney general, but many saw the proposal as politically motivated, since at the time Democrat Jan Graham held the office.</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51593842&amp;itype=CMSID\">In 2011, then-Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, floated the idea</a>, arguing it would attract better candidates and alleviate conflicts that arise when they solicit money from people they may have to investigate or prosecute. Two years later, <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56315756&amp;itype=CMSID\">amid the Swallow-Shurtleff uproar, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, revived the proposal</a>, but it has never gained much traction.</p><p>Gov. Cox, who is McKell’s brother-in-law, has said he <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-governor-spencer-cox-attorney-general-sean-reyes-tim-ballard-operation-underground-railroad-mike-mckell-legislature-appoint-elect-ag-office-politics\">believes appointing an attorney general is the best option</a>.</p><p>Reyes has <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2023-11-28/with-reyes-under-scrutiny-is-appointing-utahs-attorney-general-the-answer\">argued it would be a mistake to change the selection process</a> because “appointed A.G.s can’t exercise independent discretion or decision-making, and they become just an extension of the governor or whoever appoints them.”</p><p>While some states have moved from an appointed attorney general to an elected one, <a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/973-994-Online.pdf\">no state has gone in the other direction</a>, according to a 2014 Harvard Law Review article.</p><p>Former state Rep. Lowry Snow, who also served as president of the Utah Bar, said it’s unlikely that voters would support a constitutional amendment that takes away their ability to elect an attorney general.</p><p>“I don’t want to say we’re stuck with — that’s the wrong word — but I don’t see Utah changing its system of how the attorney general is selected,” he said. “So what can we do?”</p><p>Snow said the Legislature could beef up its oversight of the office, with lawmakers taking a deep dive during the summer into how the office is run and requiring the attorney general to provide a report to — and answer questions from — legislators.</p><p>“What I’m really talking about here is transparency and accountability,” Snow said. “I think with our current attorney general and to a large extent his predecessors whom we’ve had issues with, we haven’t had the degree of transparency we should have for the public benefit.”</p><p>For his part, Stoddard is exploring the idea of prohibiting the attorney general from doing legal work outside the office — a limitation that is in place for county attorneys but not at the state level.</p><p>McKell and Stoddard also say the state needs to explore upping the attorney general’s salary. Currently, Utah’s attorney general is paid $173,755 a year. That is well above the average Utah income and the $141,825 average salary for attorneys general nationally, <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/interim/2023/pdf/00004694.pdf\">according to a report earlier this year by a Utah legislative commission that reviews salaries</a>, but it remains significantly lower than comparable private-sector salaries, especially for the head of a large firm.</p><p>“An entry-level associate in downtown Salt Lake makes about the same salary as the sitting attorney general,” said McKell, who is a lawyer. “It opens up the attorney general to these side hustles as we’ve seen for three in a row. And it just decreases the quality of the candidates we get.”</p><p>Stoddard said that also makes the various perks dangled in front of the attorney general — like junkets on private jets — more attractive and creates a sense that he or she is entitled to take them.</p><p>But, as Toth notes, on some level, the job also requires someone willing to turn down perks, refuse problematic contributions, eschew partisan grandstanding and focus on administering justice fairly.</p><p>“At the highest level, it’s a failure to remember it’s not about you. It’s about your constituents,” he said. “It’s a failure to maintain standards of professional conduct for yourself. You’ve got to draw a line somewhere. You’ve got to set standards and adhere to those.”</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

They have some common themes: accidentally coming to school in my pajamas, a classroom full of ornery students who throw things at me, getting lost in a labyrinthian school, zombies — you know, the usual.</p><p>Once school begins and I get to once again get to connect with and teach my students, the stress dreams fade and I gear up for the real nightmare — Utah’s state legislative session and its often-divisive impact on our school communities.</p><p>Like many teachers, I follow the session closely and grapple with a feeling of dread for the full 45 days and the days before, anticipating proposed legislation that would negatively affect our students by adding red tape, extra work for teachers who are already maxed out on their time and energy and an unnecessarily adversarial quality to the relationships between teachers, schools and the families they serve.</p><p>The first few numbered bills are now live on the <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/DynaBill/BillList?session=2024GS\" target=\"_blank\">Utah State Legislature</a> website, and there are already a few to be wary of (and, looking at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/03/02/transparency-curriculum-teachers-parents-rights/\" target=\"_blank\">national trends</a> as well as bills from previous sessions, we know more are coming).</p><p><a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0029.html\" target=\"_blank\">HB 29</a>, for example, would drastically increase the reach of partisan elected officials by allowing them (in addition to a school employee, student or parent) to challenge the appropriateness of any instructional material — book, worksheet, video, website or anything else a teacher may use in the classroom — from any school district within the area they represent. It would then be up to the district to determine if the instructional material constitutes a violation of state laws regarding pornography. Districts must consider if the material has “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” which requires an incredibly subjective evaluation that school districts have disagreed on as recently as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/10/23/we-looked-banned-books-utahs/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>. If HB 29 passes, it would only take three school districts banning a book or other instructional material to require districts across the state to yank it from the shelves, even if their school community disagrees with that subjective evaluation of its literary (or other) value.</p><p>This is just one of many upcoming bills designed to convince our community that teachers are untrustworthy and secretive, and that public schools are on a mission to indoctrinate students and ruin our state. The truth is, our schools are more accountable, transparent and accessible than they have ever been. The <a href=\"https://www.schools.utah.gov/administrativerules\" target=\"_blank\">state school board</a> and our local school boards establish detailed policies to ensure safety, accountability and fairness in our classrooms and have discipline or corrective procedures for if schools or teachers fall short. Every school has a <a href=\"https://www.utahpta.org/school-community-councils\" target=\"_blank\">School Community Council </a>of parents who have a direct vote on decisions the school makes. Teachers use content-specific and <a href=\"https://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/utahcorestandards\" target=\"_blank\">state board-approved core standards</a> to guide their instruction and selection of curriculum so it’s easy to search for what big ideas or skills students will be expected to learn. They often post assignments, readings and slides online for students (or parents) to access on platforms such as Canvas. Parents can also closely follow their student’s attendance, assignments and grades using online student information systems such as Power School or Skyward.</p><p>When the legislative session rolls around, if you see a bill that purports to improve our education system by regulating or micromanaging the daily work of teachers, making our schools more “transparent,” or removing materials that experienced, professional teachers and librarians have selected in alignment with school values and state standards, ask the teachers in your community how they feel about it. It is likely that the bills will be designed to solve a problem that doesn’t exist and will create significantly more work, stress, and unnecessary red tape for teachers and schools. Then, speak up as a parent and say these bills are not what our state needs.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>If you have a question or concern about something your child is learning, you can email the teacher and ask about it.

Western water managers aren’t keen to pursue either of those options.</p><p>“The Colorado River Basin has come together over the past year to create a consensus path to stabilize the system in the short term that now allows us to focus on the future,” Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said in a statement to The Tribune. “The Bureau of Reclamation is working with all partners across the Basin on what the operations of this critical system will look like Post 2026.”</p><p>Reclamation will consider the states’ timely proposal as one of several options for managing the Colorado River in future decades as they undertake the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) steps for post-2026 operations.</p><p>Haas said that she is optimistic about the states having a plan ready in time, despite the arduous months of negotiations ahead.</p><p>“If we want to control our destiny, if we want to have a stake in this, then we’ve got to put an alternative forth to be considered and evaluated,” Haas added.</p><p>When it comes to devising a plan to manage a river that sustains 40 million people, 30 tribes and many delicate ecosystems, there’s a lot to consider.</p><p>Serving as a disillusioning backdrop for negotiations is the fact that the Colorado River’s flows, which fill Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have decreased by 20% since the turn of the century. In the coming decades, water managers have to take the West’s hotter and drier climate into account.</p><p>“We’ve got to plan for the variability of hydrology, especially given climate change,” Haas said. “We have to have the tools and the flexibility to operate under a range of conditions. That’s the bottom line.”</p><p>Haas said that water negotiators are also considering<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/01/04/how-last-years-winter-continues/\" target=\"_blank\"> this winter’s lack of precipitation</a> in their discussions about the future.</p><p>The Upper Basin states (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) will also have to work with the states of the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada) to decide how to divide the river’s water — and how to conserve it. The Lower Basin states have already promised to cut their water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, as <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2023/12/15/californias-colorado-river-water/\" target=\"_blank\">part of a separate agreement</a> independent of post-2026 negotiations.</p><p>Negotiators must also consider the water rights of the federally recognized Native American tribes that call the Colorado River Basin home. To do so, the Department of the Interior invited all 30 tribes and the seven states to participate in a <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/news-release/4603\" target=\"_blank\">Federal-Tribal-State partnership, the first of its kind</a>.</p><p>“We developed the first-ever Federal-Tribal-State partnership group to promote equitable information-sharing and inclusive discussions among the Tribal Nations and States in the Colorado River Basin and have had several meetings since its inception last summer,” Touton said. “As the range of alternatives for operations post-2026 are developed, Reclamation is committed to an inclusive and transparent process with all our partners and the public.”</p><p>Even if the Colorado River Basin states get their plan to Reclamation in time, that doesn’t guarantee that federal officials will approve their plan. Reclamation could accept their plan wholesale, but the agency can also pick and choose different parts of the plan to approve at their discretion to develop different alternatives for post-2026 operations.</p><p>Reclamation wants to start modeling potential alternatives in April, Haas said, to publish a draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 operations by the end of 2024.</p><p><i><b>Editor’s note 2:39 pm Jan. 8, 2024: </b></i><i>This article was updated with comments from the Bureau of Reclamation about collaboration and tribal input in the negotiations.</i></p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n\\n</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'The question Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla says he struggled with during his interview with the Utah Jazz',\n   'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': 'The question Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla says he struggled with during his interview with the Utah Jazz'},\n   'links': [{'rel': 'alternate',\n     'type': 'text/html',\n     'href': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/'}],\n   'link': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/',\n   'id': 'https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/06/will-hardy-joe-mazzulla-reflect/',\n   'guidislink': False,\n   'authors': [{'name': 'Eric Walden'}],\n   'author': 'Eric Walden',\n   'author_detail': {'name': 'Eric Walden'},\n   'published': 'Sun, 07 Jan 2024 23:14:29 +0000',\n   'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=23, tm_min=14, tm_sec=29, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=7, tm_isdst=0),\n   'summary': \"Ahead of Friday’s Jazz-Celtics game, colleagues-turned-counterparts Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla discussed their once-competing bids to get Utah's head coaching job, and how their respective answers to one particular question may have proved a sliding-door moment.\",\n   'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html',\n    'language': None,\n    'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n    'value': \"Ahead of Friday’s Jazz-Celtics game, colleagues-turned-counterparts Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla discussed their once-competing bids to get Utah's head coaching job, and how their respective answers to one particular question may have proved a sliding-door moment.\"},\n   'content': [{'type': 'text/html',\n     'language': None,\n     'base': 'https://www.sltrib.com/rss/feed/?sec=/News/Utah/&level=1',\n     'value': '<p><b>Boston</b> • Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla spent the 2021-22 season as coworkers, both highly regarded assistant coaches on Ime Udoka’s Boston Celtics staff.</p><p>So highly regarded that, at the end of that season, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2022/06/28/utah-jazz-select-will-hardy/\" target=\"_blank\">both men were finalists</a> to replace Quin Snyder as head coach of the Utah Jazz.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2022/07/05/new-utah-jazz-coach-will-hardy/\" target=\"_blank\">We know how that turned out</a>.</p><p>Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/01/05/utah-jazzs-brutal-stretch-begins/\" target=\"_blank\">Friday’s game at TD Garden between the Jazz and Celtics</a>, Mazzulla — who would wind up getting Boston’s top job months after not landing Utah’s — was asked what he learned from the experience of interviewing with the Jazz.</p><p>“Never wear a suit ever again,” he quipped. “I wore a suit, and I was the most uncomfortable. I’m really pissed that I did that.”</p><p>More seriously, he reflected upon how one response he gave to Utah’s decision-makers perhaps proved a sliding-door moment.</p><p>“I kind of felt like in that interview, they asked me a particular question that I wasn’t quite ready to answer,” Mazzulla said. “It was like, ‘Do you think, at a young age, you can run an organization?’ And I knew I could, but I didn’t give off the answer that I needed to give to get the job.”</p><p>(Those two are currently the youngest head coaches in the NBA, with Hardy turning 36 years old in just over two weeks, and Mazzulla following suit in five more months.)</p><p>Mazzulla was subsequently asked if the Jazz had told him they found his answer lacking or if it was just something he intuited.</p><p>“I just felt that. I could just feel,” he said. “Not that they were wrong in that, by the way. They made the right choice in hiring Will, I want to be clear on that.”</p><p><i>So you’re not as good a coach as Will?</i> a reporter jokingly asked.</p><p>“No,” Mazzulla replied earnestly.</p><p>Just days before their 2022 training camp, the Celtics suspended Udoka for at least the 2022-23 season for violations of the team’s code of conduct.</p><p>When Mazzulla got an interview for what was then an interim promotion, he found his prior experience with the Jazz helpful this time around.</p><p>“Going through that process helped me articulate <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4324351/2023/03/19/danny-ainge-joe-mazzulla-jazz-celtics/\" target=\"_blank\">my strengths and what I think I can do</a>,” he said. “That was a good process to have to go through.”</p><p>After Mazzulla finished his pregame media session Friday, Hardy was asked how he handled that same query in his interview with the Jazz.</p><p>“I don’t know how that specific answer went — I didn’t get a report card after,” he replied dryly. “But I just tried to be as honest as possible, like, ‘I don’t have all the answers right now.’ I think when you’re young as a coach going into those interviews, there’s no reason to hide from those facts: Yes, I am young; yes, I’ve never been a head coach, but I think sometimes there’s strength in that. I’m not a finished product, I’m not rigid, I’m not walking in with a giant notebook that’s like, ‘Here’s my program, take it or leave it.’ I still don’t think I have all the answers.”</p><p>He would add that, as a mid-30s person now in his second year of his first-ever head coaching job, there’s still very much an acclimation process going on.</p><p>But he also feels like that’s a good thing.</p><p>“Leading an organization is hard, being in this seat is different than being an assistant in a thousand ways,” Hardy said. “You feel everything that happens, good or bad, in a very different way than when you’re an assistant. You feel a responsibility for not only the players, but you feel a responsibility for the people that you’ve hired and work with you every day.</p><p>“It’s something I’m still getting used to. I kind of hope I never fully get used to it,” he continued. “I think some of that anxiety or stress keeps you sharp — or it keeps <i>me</i> sharp. I do OK with some of that; you obviously don’t want to overload it, but it keeps me in the moment and keeps me on the next thing.”</p><p>The reflection bit over with, he naturally had to revert to sarcasm at the end.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll go back and ask [CEO Danny Ainge] what he thought of my answer,” Hardy said. “It’ll give us something to talk about.”</p>'}]},\n  {'title': 'The best cocktail in Salt Lake?

But watering holes farther away required friendly designated drivers, geographic travel optimization, and, well, a lot of drinking.</p><p>Here’s a map of Vallarta’s 2023 journey. Dots on the map pop up to represent when in the year Vallarta visited each bar around the county.</p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p>She started out slowly, with those bars closer to her home. She didn’t hit the 50-bar mark until the end of April, but a late flourish of 83 bars visited in October, November and December ensured success before the year′s last call.</p><p>As Salt Lake’s foremost bar tourist, what can Vallarta teach us from her travels? Here’s what she said about her experiences — and Utah’s bar scene as a whole.</p><p>What makes a good bar?</p><p>Disappointingly, Vallarta declined to answer my obvious question.</p><p>“What’s the best bar in Salt Lake?”</p><p>She didn’t rank all 211 bars, which does feel understandable, and didn’t want to get into the cutthroat world of comparing these small businesses. <a href=\"https://saltlake.citycast.fm/best/the-best-salt-lake-bars-for-every-occasion\" target=\"_blank\">She has favorites for different occasions</a>: a first date (Junior’s), an anniversary (Bar Nohm or Sayonara), or a night at a dive (Bongo or Club 48).</p><p>But Vallarta said that there was clear continuity in her favorite bars, different types though they may be:</p><p>“A great bar is so clear in its identity, that when you walk in, you know what’s expected of you,” she said. “How to behave, and what is being offered, and what is not being offered. A bad bar is a bar without a clear identity.”</p><p>And most of all, through her conversations with people around the valley, she found another commonality:</p><p>“A key takeaway from this journey is that the best bar is the one closest to you,” she said.</p><p>Do the bars feel safe?</p><p>Another question that Vallarta said she heard frequently: “Did you ever feel unsafe during your quest?”</p><p>She said she didn’t — that “not once” did she feel either unsafe or even unwelcomed at the bar she was at. She acknowledges that her project’s usual modus operandi, popping into a bar for a drink or two, might have led to different feelings than for someone who stayed longer. Bad things do sometimes happen at bars.</p><img alt=\"(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.\" height=\"4032\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/OKk7979wFMWrya3jmMKBixQJC_I=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/PY7K4R3KNBCT5B4P4YRG2GR4PU.jpg\" width=\"3024\" /><br /><caption>(Ali Vallarta) The interior of HK Brewing Collective Taproom &amp; Bar.</caption><p>But in general, she felt that some bars just got a bad rap from people who didn’t know better.</p><p>“I think the implication of that question is — were these places seedy?” Vallarta said. “I went to a lot of dive bars, and I didn’t really meet seedy people, I met people who just think that the best bar is the one closest to their house.”</p><p>Bar staff deserved a lot of credit, too.</p><p>“I would attribute never feeling unsafe to how lucky we are to have really great bartenders and bouncers in Salt Lake County. I’m not just talking about your favorite door guy you know,” Vallarta said. “I’m talking about — when I went to the Second Amendment-themed bar in Herriman ... they could not have been more welcoming.”</p><p>What’s the best drink in Salt Lake County?</p><p>OK, Vallarta couldn’t try every drink in the county — nor did she really try to. But especially at Salt Lake County’s cocktail bars, she asked bartenders to recommend the best drinks they had available.</p><p>And one stood out: Seabird’s “Nine Post Cards” cocktail. At locations in Draper and the Gateway in Salt Lake City, Seabird’s bartenders make the drink with Suntory’s Haku vodka, pear liqueur, sesame miso syrup, and lemon juice. The cocktail costs a pricey $14. Still, she says it was worth it.</p><p>“It was divine,” Vallarta says. “It’s hard to say because sometimes you taste something delicious, and it’s also about the moment, what you ate an hour before, what you’re in the mood for. But this was just a good a-- drink.”</p><p>Notable bar crawls</p><p>In order to accomplish her goal, Vallarta organized many of her bar trips into weekend bar crawls, in which she’d visit establishments in a particular location or with a particular theme. These days became some of the highlights of the year.</p><p>• First, she says, was her Fourth of July bar crawl in Magna, which featured five different establishments.</p><p>“The Fourth of July in Magna is tremendous,” Vallarta said. “There’s a bustle about it. There’s a chaos about it. ... People are just down to clown. When you’re in Magna, you’re almost like ‘Are we in Nevada?’”</p><img alt=\"(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.\" height=\"2932\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/_CwqDhkNekodOHbvvujjDLOQwvs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/VOD4UUDTZJGU5PUPN66EWZOUF4.jpg\" width=\"3022\" /><br /><caption>(Kylie Fitch) Podcast host Ali Vallarta drinks at Boomerang\\'s Down Under Bar in Millcreek.</caption><p>• Another notable trip: the Saturday she visited all nine ‘Bout Time Pub &amp; Grub establishments in the county. A large group of friends and even just curious acquaintances joined the shenanigans. The chain is by far the most ubiquitous bar in the valley. Vallarta says that the ‘Bout Time location in West Valley City near the Maverik Center is the best one of the bunch.</p><p>• She organized two crawls in which she visited bars that aren’t open to the general public — those at country clubs and those for veterans. Sometimes, those clubs opened their doors when Vallarta explained her resolution, at others, she found a club member who “sponsored” her for a day.</p><p>The impact of Utah’s liquor laws</p><p>One of Vallarta’s most interesting takeaways was how Utah’s liquor laws impacted bars’ successes or failures.</p><p>First, Vallarta noted a relative lack of neighborhood bars. Because state regulations prohibit bars from being near churches, schools, libraries, parks, and playgrounds, they tend to be pushed to unusual places, or bigger retail developments — ironically, farther away from where people are likely to live. As a result, not many people can walk to a neighborhood bar outside of downtown Salt Lake City.</p><p>But Utah’s strict limit on the number of bar licenses available — one for every 10,200 residents — also had an impact on the character of new bars that open, Vallarta believes.</p><p>In short, the DABS only gives licenses to bars that are ready to open immediately. As a result, new bar owners must pay rent, develop a space, hire staff, and have supplies ready for months before opening a bar — a huge initial expense. But bar owners can’t really advertise about a new bar opening, either, because there’s no known opening date.</p><p>“You definitely notice a difference between places that are long established and places that are new,” Vallarta said. “It almost feels like you need to have some sort of like a gimmick or a very specific identity — like you’re trying to become the talk of the town. You’re trying to generate more enthusiasm than I think is appropriate for any new business to have to generate while opening their doors and training.”</p><p>But while the bars themselves differ, Vallarta says there’s value to any bar in Utah.</p><p>“Especially in Utah, being a place where people can gather (is important),” Vallarta said. “It’s a third space, where people can gather and where it’s not unacceptable or rude or bothersome to strike up a conversation with a stranger. There’s a little bit of identity politics at play when you’re in a bar in the state, because right away, people start to make inferences about your lifestyle.”</p><p>It’s true — bargoers are a little rarer around here. But perhaps there’s a lesson there: the inside of every bar, no matter the zip code, has its own community, and perhaps those communities have more in common than you might anticipate.</p><p>Take it from someone who’s been to all of them.</p><p><b>Editor’s note •</b> <i>This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

Spencer Cox’s December news conference and his comments about the proliferation and apparent ineffectiveness of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies. However, the two articles published on the subject (<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">the first on Dec. 20</a>, the second on <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/21/gov-cox-shares-no-evidence-that/\" target=\"_blank\">Dec. 21</a>) fail to capture the reality of DEI implementation and its impact on higher education.</p><p>While the articles are informative, their underlying purpose seems to be to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the governor’s concerns. As someone who has taught at the university level for more than two decades, and who has watched in dismay as the zero-sum, DEI mindset has infiltrated higher education, Cox’s concerns are not only legitimate, they are commendable.</p><p>Nothing is more crucial to the perpetuation of a bad idea than the misrepresentation of anything or anyone who disagrees with it. Take, for instance, the first sentence of the article “<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">Bordering on Evil”: Diversity hiring practices at Utah’s universities will end in 2024, Cox says</a>: “Gov. Spencer Cox attacked diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs at Utah’s colleges and universities, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/13/very-political-diversity-efforts/\" target=\"_blank\">repeating his assertion that such initiatives foster divisiveness</a> instead of inclusivity, during his monthly news conference Wednesday.”</p><p>With a lede and first sentence like this, readers might reasonably wonder how exactly Cox “attacked” DEI. Unfortunately, neither article answers this question, so I watched the news conference. Far from what the article would have me believe, I found Cox’s discussion of DEI to be both measured and honest as well as contrary to the prevailing DEI orthodoxy. Thus, according to the interpretation offered by the article, to disagree with DEI is to “attack” it.</p><p>This dangerous conflation is known as “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716590/\" target=\"_blank\">concept creep</a>,” which, according to professor of psychology Nick Haslam, who coined the term in 2016, “is the process by which harm-related topics experience semantic expansion to include topics which would not have originally been envisaged to be included under that label.”</p><p>Put simply, where once we could agree on the meaning of words, concept creep has expanded the meaning of words such as trauma, harm and racist to the point of meaninglessness. Add to this the similarly destructive idea that words are violence and the prospect of having much needed, difficult conversations is essentially reduced to nil.</p><p>On the off chance these conversations do take place, in my experience, they are often undermined by power dynamics between participants and characterized by confusion, particularly when it comes to the meaning of DEI-related terms. In fact, I would argue that when it comes to DEI, confusion is a feature, not a bug.</p><p><div class=\"newsletter-embeds-recaptcha\" id=\"newsletter-embed\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n function onSignUp() {\\n   const token = grecaptcha.getResponse();\\n   if (!token) {\\n     alert(\"Please verify the reCAPTCHA!\");\\n   } else {\\n     axios\\n       .post(\\n         \"https://8c0ug47jei.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/newsletter/checkCaptcha\",\\n         {\\n           token,\\n           env: \"PROD\",\\n         }\\n       )\\n       .then(({ data: { message } }) =&gt; {\\n         console.log(message);\\n         if (message === \"Human 👨 👩\") {\\n           document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\").removeAttribute(\"disabled\");\\n         } else {\\n           console.log(\"ROBOTO\");\\n         }\\n       });\\n   }\\n }\\n</p><p>I therefore think that Cox can be forgiven for what appears to be some confusion of his own, namely, that university employees are required to sign diversity statements as a condition of employment. Although diversity statements <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-universitys-new-loyalty-oath-11576799749\" target=\"_blank\">have indeed been used</a> by universities <a href=\"https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2019/12/31/life-science-jobs-at-berkeley-with-hiring-giving-precedence-to-diversity-and-inclusion-statements/\" target=\"_blank\">to filter applicants</a> on the basis of race and gender, I don’t think there is any evidence that the Utah university system requires prospective employees to sign a diversity statement.</p><p>But as even the most cursory examination of the job boards for any of the state’s institutions of higher education will show, diversity statements are in fact a regular part of employee applications.</p><p>One might reasonably ask, then, what is the difference between being required to sign a diversity statement and requiring applicants to submit one as part of an application for employment? Perhaps that is a Tribune article for another day. Also for another day might be a follow up article investigating Cox’s concern that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/12/20/bordering-evil-diversity-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">DEI programs are bloated and ineffective</a>.</p><p>Whether from the point of view of university members, tax payers, state legislators or the Utah Board of Higher Education, these are valid questions and as someone who, like university professors themselves, is obligated to represent everyone he serves, Cox is right to ask them.</p><p>My own concern, however, is that making inquiries such as these is, in the eyes of some, tantamount to aiding and abetting. Consequently, those best positioned to inform the public may lack the will to do so for fear of being ostracized or worse, or because they too believe that the current trajectory is the only way forward, regardless of all the good, the right and the true they will have to sacrifice along the way.</p><p>I say this not to disparage the many well-intentioned people who, like me, are trying to make our universities better for everyone (the what), but rather to elucidate some of the very real obstacles to doing precisely that (the how).</p><p>The willful misrepresentation of reality is nothing new, but given the purported goals of DEI and the fact that everyone has a stake in realizing them, we all have a responsibility to privilege the truth, however elusive, difficult or unpopular it may be.</p><img alt=\"Maximilian Werner\" height=\"2316\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/R2pKXCE9kj5BEIbht5M_MDImKwo=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/SASCF7GJ2RHO3POQHET6K5U3UE.jpg\" width=\"2276\" /><br /><caption>Maximilian Werner</caption><p><b>Maximilian Werner</b><i> used to be a Democrat, but now he is politically unhoused and, given the way things are going, expects to remain that way for the foreseeable future.</i></p><p><i>The Salt Lake Tribune is committed to creating a space where Utahns can share ideas, perspectives and solutions that move our state forward.

The small Diné community on the Utah-Arizona border, marked by photogenic sandstone towers, is situated in the largest geographical House district in the Beehive State — District 69.</p><p>”A lot of our elderly would always state that they wanted our young Native children to go get an education, to learn as much, gain as much experience, and come back and help our communities,” Smith said. “When the opportunity came up of if I wanted to run, I felt that was the moment.”</p><p>So, in 2022, Smith decided that she’d use her life and professional experiences — like struggling to find housing, helping vulnerable populations access health care and advocating to protect open lands — to run to represent her home district in the Legislature, challenging a Republican who’d won unopposed during the previous election cycle.</p><p>But 29 other Republican lawmakers were uncontested last year. Now an outside group is wading into conservative-leaning Utah to recruit Democrats to follow Smith’s lead and jump into races where Republican names were the only ones on the ballot.</p><p>Contesting every race</p><p>Contest Every Race is a project by Movement Labs, an incubator for progressive organizing. It launched a grant program in 2021 to add more Democrats to ballots across the country, with an early focus in purple and deep red states, and <a href=\"https://www.contesteveryrace.com/about/mission\" target=\"_blank\">ambitious plans</a> to help the party contest every electoral competition in the U.S. by 2028.</p><p>This fall, the nonprofit partnered with the Utah Democratic Party to ping phones in all 29 counties, urging people to run in legislative and other down-ballot races. According to its website, issues like the health of democracy, abortion access, racial justice and climate change are at stake in stake in each of these contests.</p><p>“Hi [insert name], we’re looking for Dems in [insert municipality] to run for local office,” texts read. “Want info on how to run?”</p><p>Recipients who reply “yes” can sign up for a coaching call to get answers to any questions they might have, said Daniel Jubelirer, the chief of staff for Contest Every Race. That’s followed by what Jubelirer described as a “drip of information,” including the open races in their area and what’s involved in running for public office, “to really begin the discernment process about if that is something that they want to do.”</p><img alt=\"(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Citizens vote at the Salt Lake County Government Center on Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023.\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/n0lAcp7eF62lfMmKbr2TMco-AFE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/A3QLNU6R4VGE7OLIPXYN5WFKSY.jpg\" width=\"3000\" /><br /><caption>(Trent Nelson  |  The Salt Lake Tribune) Citizens vote at the Salt Lake County Government Center on Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023. (Trent Nelson/)</caption><p>In addition to uncontested legislative races, Democrats have their eye on smaller races throughout the state with aims to build a pipeline of future candidates for larger posts.</p><p>“It’s not likely that an everyday working mom or young person that recently turned 18 is going to file for statewide office out of a text, but they might run for their local school board or their local city council,” Jubelirer said. “And we’ve seen that happen, and then those people are developing their leadership skills, getting governing experience, policy experience, and this is really our way of building the bench of potential folks who could run for statewide office.”</p><p>To recruit candidates who are new to politics, Jubelirer added, Democrats need to have local infrastructure in place to support them. So the initiative is also offering $2,000 in grants annually to county parties that are willing to complete monthly goals, like hosting outreach events and tabling at community celebrations.</p><p>All of Utah’s 29 counties have a Democratic party, according to the state party’s website. But at least two of the most rural counties don’t have any leadership listed. Many of Utah’s county Democratic parties <a href=\"https://disclosures.utah.gov/Search/PublicSearch?type=PARTY\" target=\"_blank\">have not reported financial contributions</a> to the state in over a decade.</p><p>Jubelirer said county parties have long been under-invested in by state parties and the Democratic National Committee. While he acknowledged that $2,000 is a small contribution when looked at through the lens of finances in national races, Jubelirer said some parties have been able to use it to rent office space or purchase phones for low-income volunteers.</p><p>‘Small d democratic process</p><p>A lack of Democratic candidates in state legislative races extends beyond Utah’s most remote counties. Republicans without opponents won numerous seats along the Wasatch Front and up and down the Interstate 15 corridor in 2022.</p><p>Approximately one-third of state legislative seats up for election last year were won by Republicans without opponents. An additional 13% of winning lawmakers were Republicans who only faced third-party challengers, meaning Democrats didn’t have a candidate in nearly half of state legislative races.</p><p>Two Democrats in blue Salt Lake County won House races uncontested last year.</p><p>A different set of Senate seats will be up for reelection in 2024 for the first time since <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/11/08/five-things-you-need-know/\" target=\"_blank\">new boundaries were drawn</a>. Approximately one-third of Senate seats not up for election in 2022 were held by Republicans who were previously uncontested, and nearly 60% of their races didn’t include Democrats.</p><p><i>[The story continues below these maps.]</i></p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"></div></p><p>The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature by 12 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate. The number of uncontested seats won by Republicans — in both bodies — in 2022 exceeded those numbers.</p><p>In recent years, the weight of the Republican supermajority has been used to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/04/11/utah-legislature-to-call-veto-override-session-extending-battle-with-gov-gary-herbert-over-separation-of-powers/\" target=\"_blank\">grab power from the executive branch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/25/utah-lawmakers-likely/#:~:text=%7C%20Updated%3A%20March%2026%2C%202022,to%20take%20effect%20July%201.\" target=\"_blank\">override vetoes</a>, like Gov. Spencer Cox’s rejection of a bill that would ban transgender students from playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity.</p><p>“It’s not really a ‘small d’ democratic process if people only have one option to vote for,” said Thom DeSirant, the executive director of the Utah Democratic Party. “You get your ballot and you just have one option — you can’t really exercise your right to vote unless you choose to just leave the option blank, which is not something we want people to do.”</p><p>“I think that just having these races contested also helps increase turnout in general,” he added. “People just see one option on the ballot, they feel like there’s no reason to even vote.”</p><p>Brigham Young University political science professor Adam Brown, who has <a href=\"https://adambrown.info/p/research/utah_legislature\" target=\"_blank\">compiled an in-depth guide</a> to the Utah Legislature, agrees that ideally, both parties would contest every race — from Republicans running in Salt Lake City’s Avenues neighborhood to Democrats competing in St. George.</p><p>But he isn’t sure that it would result in more Democrats getting elected, or whether it would even push Republicans fighting for reelection closer to the political center. The results of Contest Every Race’s efforts in Utah will likely vary district-by-district, Brown said, and would depend on how competitive the race is and how “much the incumbent believes that a loss is possible.”</p><p>“Every officeholder thinks to some extent about staying in office. In most of the state, there is so little competition that this concern only revolves around renomination,” Brown wrote in an email.</p><p>“An opponent in the general election with a real chance of winning would obviously force incumbents to more carefully balance their renomination constituency against their general election [constituency] — ... the issue that Republican and Democratic legislators in purplish places like Taylorsville, West Valley, and Sandy confront.”</p><p>In other states where Contest Every Race has recruited Democratic candidates, Jubelirer said about 38% of the approximately 5,500 political newcomers won their races. Another perk of recruiting more candidates to the ballot for Democrats, Jubelirer noted, is that it would likely increase the number of votes going toward Democratic congressional and presidential candidates.</p><img alt=\"(Zak Podmore | The Salt Lake Tribune) Davina Smith holds a campaign sign in Monument Valley at an event announcing she\\'ll be running for the Utah House of Representatives.

These dead-end streets are where schools are teaching our kids what to think instead of how to think, where government right now is handing out so much money that some people can live better lives with handouts than they can by going and earning a paycheck.”</p><p>An early August news release from Wilson’s exploratory committee boasted the support of several dozen “conservative Utah legislators,” saying they were endorsing and encouraging him to run.
